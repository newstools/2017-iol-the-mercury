It is understood that the two were employees at the restaurant and that they got into an argument in the kitchen.

Things quickly got out of hand when the suspect allegedly produced a knife and slit the throat of the victim - identified by police as 32-year-old Sizwe Shange.

Marshall Security spokesperson Kyle van Reenen confirmed the private security company had been dispatched to a murder at a Durban North restaurant on Saturday night.

“We were called shortly after 7.30pm. Paramedics were also called to assist.

"However, there was nothing that could be done to save the man and he was declared dead on the scene,” he said.

The crime scene was secured and handed over to the police for investigation and processing. One of the owners of Republik, Matt Richardson, confirmed that the incident had taken place.

He was, however, not there at the time and could not provide details regarding what exactly had transpired.

He said the restaurant was co-operating fully with police.

Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was being investigated by Durban North SAPS.

“A 32-year-old man was stabbed to death at 8pm by a known suspect,” she said. “A 22-year-old suspect was arrested for murder. He will appear in court soon.”
