Durban – A Durban man accused of raping two of his daughters says he did not do it.

Testifying in his bail application in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, the man – who cannot be identified, to protect his children – said he did not know where the allegations against him came from.

The man was arrested after one of his children, who is nine-years-old, reported the alleged crimes to a teacher who informed the police.
Reports that he had also raped his 15-year-old then emerged.
He said he could afford between R3 000 and R4 000 for bail.

The State is opposing his bail.

His bail application continues.
