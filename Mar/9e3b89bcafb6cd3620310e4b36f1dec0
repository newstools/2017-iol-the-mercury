Durban Police have arrested a 43-year-old man in connection with the murders of Christine and Roger Solikin Nottingham Road, in the Midlands, two weeks ago.Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed this to The Mercury on Wednesday. She said the man would be charged with murder, kidnapping and house robbery and was expected to appear in the Howick Magistrate s Court on Friday. Further information cannot be revealed at this stage as the investigation is continuing, Mbele said.The arrest follows an intensive, two-week long manhunt by police.It is believed the Soliks were murdered after a robbery in their home in an upmarket estate.They were reported missing after a concerned neighbour went to check on them and found that their home had been ransacked. There were bloodstains in the house.The body of Christine, 57, was seen by a passer-by in the Lotheni River in Nzinga, Impendle, later that same day.Her hands and legs had been tied together with wire and her head was covered with a pillow case.At the time, 66-year-old Roger was still missing and, fearing that he might have been kidnapped, the family released a statement, desperately appealing for his safe return.But three days later, his body was found a few kilometres downstream from where his wife s body had been found.His hands and feet had also been bound, and a pillowcase had been pulled over his head.The community packed the Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Kloof last week, when a thanksgiving mass was held for the Soliks.The Mercury
