Durban – A massive fire gutted a Durban warehouse in South Coast Road near the port – and firefighters are still battling to contain the blaze.
The warehouse, a wax factory, spewed a massive pall of smoke over the harbour and the city. The black cloud over the could be seen as far as Ballito on the North Coast.
