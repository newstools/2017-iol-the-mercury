Cape Town - The national Department of Health has asked for more money from the Treasury and said it had a budget shortfall of R11.4billion, which would cripple its operations.
It warned Parliament on Wednesday that the multibillion rand budget shortfall would impact on hiring doctors and nurses. And these, it said, were critical posts.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Precious Matsoso, the director-general in the department, told MPs the budget cuts would impact on the delivery of essential services.

She said certain things needed to be prioritised - and warned of a looming crisis unless something was done.

Matsoso made her call for extra cash while briefing the joint committees on health and appropriations.

“The reality is that we have to make a decision whether health is delivered in this country or not,” she said.
