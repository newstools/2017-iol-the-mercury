Durban – Most people would not pay to go to jail, but the Department of Correctional Services has warned of a fresh scam where desperate job seekers are being fleeced out of hundreds – and in some cases, thousands – of rands by con artists promising them posts at the prisons in exchange for the cash.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The department’s spokesperson in KwaZulu Natal, Thulani Mdluli, said in a statement that a number of people have fallen victim to the scammers over the past few months.
Their normal modus operandi involved phoning people and, under the guise of being senior managers at the department, promising them jobs in exchange for cash in the amount of R500 to R5 000.
Mdluli said the regional office had received a number of phone calls from different people claiming they had been assured jobs and that some people had even come to their offices.
He said the scammers had even managed to secure adverts in some print media and to lure victims in this way.
“We want to stress that the department doesn’t sell any posts and furthermore the department is against this practice because it is a crime irrespective of who commits it,” Mdluli said.
