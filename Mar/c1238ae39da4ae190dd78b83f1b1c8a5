Durban – A KwaZulu-Natal preacher, accused of raping an eight-year-old boy, could be charged with more cases.
This emerged when the 21-year-old accused – who cannot be named until he has pleaded – made his second appearance in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Public prosecutor Veraysha Moodley told the court that police wanted to charge him in connection with rape and sexual assault linked to a case in Gingindlovu, north of Durban. 

And, she said, he could be linked to a Hillcrest case and two incidents in Phoenix.

A group of people seated in the gallery appeared to be supporting the accused.

Moodley said the State strongly opposed his being granted bail and that it would use his alleged links to other crimes of a similar nature to bolster its case against him.

The preacher was arrested last month following an investigation by the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.

The eight-year-old boy’s alleged rape took place at the preacher’s house in Kwangcolosi, near Hillcrest.

Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the boy and three friends were playing outside the preacher’s house when he sent the friends to buy airtime and the child was called into the home.

“The boys returned with the airtime and gave it to the preacher, who took it and closed the door."

"A few days later, the preacher called another boy into his home, but the boy refused, and when questioned by his mother about his disobedience, the boy alleged that the preacher had kissed him."

"He also reported the alleged rape of his friend by the preacher. His mother then informed the rape victim’s mother, who reported the crime."

The case is pending before court.
