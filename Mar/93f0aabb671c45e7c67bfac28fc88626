The group includes ANC members, who had arrived in buses from Ndwedwe. 
It is understood that the group were meant to wait for the main group of ANCYL members which started marching from KwaDukuza this morning but they grew impatient and have now left for Ballito.


There are several police officers on scene who are monitoring the march.
Last week, the ANCYL in the greater KwaDukuza region said they would hold a march because they believed young people in the area were being excluded from economic opportunities.


The league alleged that there was an exclusion of young people and locals in job creation regarding the development of the Ballito Junction mall. The mall’s developers have denied this is the case and stated that they have gone out of their way to reach out to the local community and provide opportunities.


Patrick Flanagan, director of the Ballito Junction Consortium, previously told The Mercury he was “disappointed” at the ANC Youth League’s attitude, saying there seemed to be a political agenda which made the league overlook the “huge, positive socio-economic impact” of the development.
