Cape Town – The Cape Town Cycle Tour was cancelled on Sunday morning due to extreme weather conditions.
More than 35 000 cyclists – amateurs and professionals – were set to tackle the gruelling 109km around the Cape Peninsula on Sunday morning but howling winds have forced organisers to call off the race.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
 All riders who have started on the route will be stopped at the end of the M3. They will be contained there and traffic authorities will escort them back on the M3.
While there were many disappointed faces at the starting line early Sunday morning, people said they understood the decision to cancel the event.
"It's disappointing considering that this was meant to be the 40th edition of this iconic event. But it's absolutely the right decision by the Cape Town Cycle Tour organisers to cancel the race.





"Safety of participants comes first and must never be compromised," said Gasant Abarder, Independent Media Western Cape's regional executive editor, who was set to ride in his fifth race today.
