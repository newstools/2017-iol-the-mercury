The foundation said Kathrada, who was affectionately known as “uncle Kathy”, passed away “peacefully” after a short period of illness, following brain surgery.
Kathrada’s activism spanned a total of 75 years. He was one of three surviving Rivonia Triallists who stood trial for treason against the apartheid government between 1963 and 1964.

In 1964, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and served 18 years on Robben Island before being transferred to Pollsmoor in Cape Town in 1982.


He was later released and served as an ANC MP under Madiba, who remained a close friend.
