Durban - More than two weeks after a failed bid to have his fraud convictions overturned, former KZN police spokesperson Vincent Mdunge has been issued with a notice to surrender.Spokesperson for the Department of Justice Mthunzi Mhaga confirmed on Wednesday that the notice had been issued at the Pietermaritzburg High Court and served on Mdunge on Tuesday. He has days to surrender before a warrant of arrest is issued.Mdunge s lawyer, Yusuf Omar, said he was unaware of this development. He said the last time he had spoken to Mdunge was on Friday. He was waiting for documents from the authorities to confirm when he needed to report to prison, Omar said.He said they were still considering taking the case to the Supreme Court of Appeal.In 2014, the Durban Regional Court convicted Mdunge for using a fake matric certificate to advance his career within the SAPS and to further his studies.&nbsp;He was convicted on one count of fraud for receiving a salary to which he was not entitled, and another for a forged matric certificate.Mdunge was sentenced to five years in prison but his bail of R5 000 was extended while he appealed against his conviction - along with his sentence - in the high court. His appeal was dismissed last month.The Mercury
