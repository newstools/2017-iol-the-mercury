In stark contrast to his open and friendly demeanour when speaking to the press on Saturday, Christopher Mbambo on Sunday flatly refused to speak journalists. He threatened to sue anyone who took his picture and said he did not want to say anything.

Accompanied by another man, he spent around 45 minutes inside the charge office and then made straight for his car afterwards.

A dramatic two-day long search for the one-month-old baby was launched on Friday after her mother, Sibongile Mbambo, reported that she had been hijacked near the Durban city centre and that the assailants had taken her car along with her infant.

The car was found in Montclair on Friday afternoon and the baby was finally located at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza in the early hours of Sunday morning.
According to one well placed police source, the baby's "kidnapping" was allegedly planned.

She has apparently been in the Hanover area in Pietermaritzburg for the last two days.

Police said three people were arrested in connection with the incident, including the mother.
