Durban - In a unexpected turn of events, it is believed that a close relative of the one-month-old Durban baby allegedly kidnapped during a hijacking on Friday has been arrested.

Multiple sources have confirmed this to The Mercury.

A dramatic two-day long search for the baby girl was launched on Friday after her mother reported that she had been hijacked near the Durban city centre and that the assailants had taken her car along with her infant.

The car was found in Montclair on Friday afternoon and the baby was finally located at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza in the early hours of Sunday morning.

According to one well placed police source, the baby's "kidnapping" was allegedly planned.

She has apparently been in the Hanover area in Pietermaritzburg for the last two days and it is understood that a handover may have been arranged.

At least two people have been arrested. Police could not be reached to confirm the developments.
