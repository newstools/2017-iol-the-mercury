Durban – Thousands of young people have made their way to the Ballito Junction Mall where they were involved in a stand-off with security.
Some marchers started to storm the premises.
They had embarked on a peaceful protest march under the co-ordination of the ANC Youth League and a memorandum was handed over to the mall’s management.
Police attempted to stop the marchers at an intersection just before they reached the mall. The local ANC Youth League leadership tried to negotiate either for the developers to come out and address the crowd or for youth leaders to be able to enter the mall.





When marchers attempted to enter the premises, security guards closed the gates, one of which, however, was forced open. The marchers were then gathered between the gates and the entrance to the shopping facility.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The Youth League has addressed the marchers and said that they had achieved their aims of delivering the memorandum, however the sentiment among many of those present was they still wanted to get into the mall.
