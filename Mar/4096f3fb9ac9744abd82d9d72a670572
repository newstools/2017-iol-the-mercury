Durban - A father found guilty of raping his daughter who he trafficked into SA, sat with his head hung between his knees, as her victim impact statement was read in the Durban Regional Court on Friday.
As he left the dock, he slammed the swinging door, clearly irritated that his case was postponed to next week, when he will hear his fate for the three charges he was found guilty of - trafficking, rape and an immigration offence. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The 40-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his daughter, pleaded guilty to the immigration offence, as he entered South Africa, with his children, from Swaziland with no paperwork.

The man was found guilty of raping his 14-year-old daughter between 2014 and 2015 in Jozini, northern KwaZulu-Natal where he worked on a mielie farm. 

The daughter fell pregnant and kept the baby.

In the statement, his daughter said: “The abuse I suffered had a very big impact on my life. When I was 9 years old he touched me. 

“When I told my mother, she did not believe me.”

The father raped her again and again, yet her mother did not believe her, and even teachers who she told about the rape were not able to help her.

“In 2014 my mother left us with him and he took us to South Africa. I no longer felt like a child; I was forced to have sex with him.”

The man will be sentenced on Tuesday.
