Durban Mystery surrounds the discovery at the weekend of a set of skeletal remains, buried beneath a Durban North home.Durban Search and Rescue on Saturday spent eight gruelling hours carefully removing the bones from the earth.They were taken to the Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street mortuary, where an autopsy is expected to be carried out.But the owner of the property, who asked not to be identified, on Sunday told The Mercury it was suspected the skeleton was actually a medical prop because pins and screws had been drilled through the bones.Police were first dispatched to the Beachway Road property on Friday after contractors, who were excavating the foundations in preparation to extend the house, made the startling find.A pathologist from the provincial medico-legal mortuary recommended that a controlled excavation be conducted in order to protect the remains.This involved cordoning off the area and using small hand tools such as trowels and brushes to painstakingly removed the sand and dirt that had collected in between the bones.They started the process on Friday, but shortly after, they were called out to the harbour to rescue a fisherman who had fallen between the concrete dolosses.They returned to Durban North the following morning.The property owner said he and his family had only recently bought the property. They were planning to move in next month and were busy renovating.He said that initially they thought the skeleton could be a dog s. We called the SAPS immediately and they came out and unearthed a skull, the man said.The next morning, after uncovering two femurs and a rib cage, the man said they realised the skeleton was full of metal joints and believed that it was probably an old medical prop.A police spokesperson was on Sunday unavailable for official comment.But teeth discovered still attached to the skull indicated that the skeleton was human.It is understood that an autopsy still needs to be carried out.The Mercury
