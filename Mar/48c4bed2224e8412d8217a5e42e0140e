This was announced after Dhlomo visited the clinic on Monday. 

Two men sneaked into the clinic premises through a back entrance and ambushed a security guard inside. 

They stole his cellphone and took his radio so he could not alert his colleague at the gate, who was oblivious to what was happening inside. 

“They commanded him to take them to where the nurses were and forcefully demanded cellphones and money from the nurses,” read a statement. 

One of the nurses was slapped and kicked. 

The robbers then fled, climbing over the gate. The guards gave chase but the robbers got away.

“These are non-negotiables; we cannot sacrifice the lives of our healthcare professionals by forcing them to work at night to become targets of tsotsis,” said Dhlomo. 

Referring to local councillor Happy Mkhize, who was with him at the clinic, Dhlomo said Mkhize too “understands the predicament our staff faces and has committed to hold public meetings and dialogues with the residents to ensure security of healthcare professionals. 

“Many will be adversely affected by this suspension of services, especially those with stab and gunshot wounds who will now have to travel to KwaMashu clinics.”

Meanwhile, the department would bring in more guards, upgrade security fencing and put up steel doors at entrances. 

“We will review this decision pending community engagement, but for now the clinic is open only during the day,” said Dhlomo. 

Arrangements would be made for women in labour to be transported by ambulance to the KwaMashu Community Health Centre.
