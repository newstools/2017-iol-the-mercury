Her mother, who is not being named due to the interests of the minor child, and a man, believed to be the mother's boyfriend and who alleges he is the biological father of the child, appeared briefly before Magistrate Mahomed Motala with scarves covering both their faces.

The court heard on Monday that charges against a third woman who was arrested on Sunday when the baby was found at Mariannhill Toll Plaza had been dropped.

The case was adjourned until Wednesday, for DNA testing to be carried out on the infant involved.

Speaking outside court, the man's lawyer, Andile Dakela, said he had been instructed by his client that he was the child's biological father and that she had been in danger, prompting his client to "act swiftly".

 


The two are currently charged with kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice.

But Dakela says the kidnapping charge could fall away if his client was proved to be the true father.

The mother had reported to police that the baby had been abducted during a hijacking in Friday, prompting a massive search.

But police believe the incident was faked.
