Wolfsburg, Germany - Volkswagen’s first promo video for the new premium five-door Arteon makes the most of its superbly proportioned profile- as well it should.

A little larger than the Passat CC it replaces - 95mm longer on a 50mm longer wheelbase and 39mm wider - its fastback shape is way more successful from every angle, including the practical view; it includes a 563 litre boot under a gaping fastback lid.

The video’s clever play of light also brings out the best in Volkswagen’s deeper, slightly more complex and very upright new front treatment; it will be very interesting to see how the designers translate that look into future generations of Golf, Polo and Tiguan.

Also featured in the video are the Arteon’s ‘virtual’ instrument cluster, and latest-generation 23.3cm  infotainment touchscreen, as well as adaptive cruise control that reads speed limit signs and adjusts its settings accordingly, and predictive cornering lights.

As noted in our launch story from the Geneva motor show, European customers will have a choice of three turbopetrols - the new 110kW 1.5-litre TSI, and two-litre TSI’s in 140kW and 206kW tuning, the latter with all-wheel drive - and three two-litre turbodiesels, tuned for 110kW, 140kW and 176kW respectively, with all wheel drive on the top variant again.

The gold-coloured Arteon in the video features the optional ‘R-Line’ pack, the white one the ‘Elegance’ option.
