A dramatic two-day long search for the one-month-old baby girl was launched on Friday after her mother reported that she had been hijacked near the Durban city centre and that the assailants had taken her car along with her infant.


Police said the baby has been placed under the care of the Social Development department.
Acting National Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane said in the statement:"We, as the South African Police Service, are extremely grateful that this innocent baby has been rescued from a dubious situation to say the least. 
"We thank our members, all other law enforcement agencies and security companies who stepped up to assist, as well as the civic minded members of the public who joined forces to assist in the search. 
"We are a wonderful, caring society and it is disappointing when people take advantage of their fellow South African’s trust and belief in humanity. False claims of crimes which have an entire nation and beyond in a state of sorrow and anxiety, should be condemned."
