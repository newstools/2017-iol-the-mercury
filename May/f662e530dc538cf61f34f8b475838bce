And the feeling was reciprocated as Keegan Daniel, S’Bura Sithole, Khaya Majola and Jacques Vermuelen arrived with a big bunch of pink roses and cakes.
Ready to share a bit of Mother’s Day magic, Daniel said, “Most of our mothers are far away on and it is a massive privilege for us to be able to visit you today.”
As the players handed out roses, resident Helena Theron was sure to tell them that she never misses a match, also predicting the Springboks will win the next World Cup. 
And the players were happy to share a little about the first lady in their lives. 
Daniel said he and his wife will be sending flowers to his mom, adding that sitting around the dinner table while growing up was one of his favourite memories. 
“Family time is always important,”” he said, while S’’bura Sithole, whose parents live in the United Kingdom said, “I’ve asked my dad to buy her a big bunch of red roses". 
Vermuelen also has plans for roses and chocolates to be delivered to his mother, saying: “I always enjoyed my mom’s food, especially her lasagne and she’s funny”.
Khaya Majola shared that his mother makes the perfect curry, “it’s not too hot, it’s just a nice flavour and my mom takes pride in her cooking. When it came to supper time, we had to be home,” he said, adding he’ll be sending her a gift card so that “she can get what she wants.”
Spokesperson for the Sharks, Novashni Chetty said the Sharks team enjoyed spending time with the community.
“This was an opportunity for an early celebration of Mother’s Day and we wanted the residents to feel special," she said. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
