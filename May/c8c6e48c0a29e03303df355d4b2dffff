Cape Town - ANC MP Makhosi Khoza fears for her life and those of her children after her arch-critics, the ANC Youth League in eThekwini, allegedly posted her home address on Facebook.
Khoza has criticised President Jacob Zuma a number of times since he reshuffled his cabinet, axing finance minister Pravin Gordhan, among others, almost two months ago.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The Youth League recently threatened to picket a book launch she attended. They also threatened to picket her home.

Khoza turned to the ANC and Parliament to intervene.

Parliament was unable to confirm on Sunday whether her request for security had landed on Speaker Baleka Mbete’s desk. Khoza said ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu had promised to raise her security issues with Mbete.

“I think they will meet to see how best to assist,” said Khoza. 

Khoza said she had also spoken to ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma. He had told her he had spoken to the Youth League and they had called off their plans for the picket.

“Super Zuma told me he asked the Youth League to stop picketing, but the damage was already done because my address was on social media. I continue to receive a barrage of attacks on my phone and on social media,” she said.

“The sad thing is that I couldn’t go home. It’s not good for our democracy to be in exile. It’s scary for my children. I am worried about my children,” said Khoza.

ANCYL regional secretary in eThekwini Thinta Cibane said they would no longer protest at Khoza’s house, and denied they had circulated her address on social media. 

“We have no intention to picket at her house. We have no intention of coming near her children. We stand against gender-based violence,” said Cibane.

Mthembu and ANC provincial spokesperson in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli, could not be reached for comment.
