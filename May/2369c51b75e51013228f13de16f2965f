“We have great appreciation for the unique role that faith-based organisations such as the SACC have to play in building a united front to defeat the malaise corruption,” said Minister Gigaba. 
The minister feels that institutions of the state should be used for the benefit of all within the South African society, and not for self-enrichment.
Minister Gigaba indicated that transformation of society to create a more inclusive economy has to be done while observing the highest standards of corporate governance. 
According to the minister, inclusive growth is meant to achieve broad-based transformation, mobilise investment, and create jobs for the benefit of all South African citizens.
