The head of one of KwaZulu-Natal’s most crucial conservation areas was rewarded for his work this week.Andrew Zaloumis, who heads the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, received the KfW-Bernhard-Grzimek-Preis in Frankfurt, Germany on Wednesday.Bernhard Klemens Maria Grzimek was a renowned German conservationist, zoo director, zoologist and author, while KfW is one of the world’s leading promotional banks.Dr Fanny Douvere, the co-ordinator of the Unesco Marine Programme in Paris, said at the ceremony: “In taking World Heritage conservation to a whole new level, (Zaloumis) has given hope to, and inspired, both the youth of iSimangaliso and his World Heritage peers.” “We are particularly pleased to honour Andrew Zaloumis, whose personal commitment to a region that is one of the richest in terms of biodiversity, but at the same time one of the most endangered in Africa, is truly in the spirit of the man who has lent his name to the biodiversity award,” said Dr Lutz-Christian Funke from the Board of KfW Stiftung.“His visionary programmes have turned a failing state asset into an important contributor to KZN’s tourism GDP,” iSimangaliso said in a statement. Zaloumis said: “In order to conserve places like iSimangaliso, we need development plans that extend beyond industrial exploitation and economic cost-benefit calculations. If we are to flourish, our continued growth rests on social justice, political inclusion and environmental responsibility.”
