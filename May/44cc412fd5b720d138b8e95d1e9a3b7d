Ultra-distance runner Caroline Wostmann will not defend her Comrades Marathon up-run title on June 4 after failing to recover from a hamstring injury.On advice from her medical team Wöstmann made the difficult decision to withdraw. Suffering a hamstring injury at last month’s Old Mutual Two Oceans, Wöstmann undertook an intensive rehabilitation regime and hoped to line up for this year’s race.“Despite aggressive recovery treatments and rehab it hasn’t healed sufficiently,” Wöstmann said. She was initially positive about the prognosis and looked set to line up for the race in just over a week’s time. “During Two Oceans I picked up a hamstring niggle where it was later diagnosed as a neural injury which was far more serious than originally presumed,” Wöstmann explained.The 34-year-old made history in 2015 when she became the first South African woman to win the Comrades Marathon in 14 years. Last year she battled through cramps in the last 15km and injury to finish second behind Charne Bosman. “I wish every one of my Comrades a life-changing adventure from Durban up to Pietermaritzburg this year,” she said.
