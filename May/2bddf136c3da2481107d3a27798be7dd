The State is still in the process of quantifying the losses it incurred, during the large scale search in March for a "kidnapped" infant, the Durban Magistrate's Court heard on Tuesday.Reports that the month-old baby girl had been abducted later turned out to be fake.After she was found, her mother and her mother's lover were arrested and charged for fraud.Â Her mother allegedly gave the infant to her lover voluntarily.The man accused of taking her claimed at the time that he was actually her father.Early on in proceedings, it was suggested that DNA testing was going to be conducted but there has been no mention of this since.The mother and lover are out on bail of R1 000 each.In their first court appearance since getting bail, they came before court briefly on Tuesday, when the matter was adjourned for further investigations.They will be back in court next month.
