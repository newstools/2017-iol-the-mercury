“This is something different as the Mandela family has a tradition of holding Sunday lunches – the whole family, every Sunday at home. It’s very special.” 
She said Mother’s Day gifts were always a surprise but the grandchildren were well aware of her love for pearls.
“Mother’s Day is every day. We are a large family in South Africa and all over the world. There is much love.
“I appreciate all the messages on this day especially those who cannot be here. 
“In truth, the presents continue long after Mother’s Day. I am pampered by the nation.” 
“In South Africa, we mother’s love children every day… not just our own children. 
“In our culture every child is your child. 
“We must extend the love on this occasion, especially to those children who don’t have mothers.”
