Johannesburg - Hundreds of Cosatu members have begun marching for Workers Day to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in Sandton to demand an end to 'white monopoly capital'. Those present are singing and dancing wearing Cosatu t-shirts and other regalia. Some of Cosatu's leadership is present along with General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali and ANC general secretary Gwede Mantashe and Gauteng ANC's Hope Papo.SACP's Jeremy Cronin said Monday's march symbolized that the country's issue were bigger and that 'white monopoly capital' was also an issue. When asked about Cosatu's decision to alllow Presidnet Jacob Zuma to speak at the main May Day rally, Cronin said the decision lied with the federation.
