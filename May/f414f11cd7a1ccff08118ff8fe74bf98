THE eThekwini Municipality fire department had a busy day yesterday attending to at least four confirmed fires.In Mayville, two rooms inside a mosque were burned. “We do not what caused the fire but it was serious as two rooms were damaged. But we managed to extinguish the blaze,” said Melvin Ramlall the Operations Division Commander.No injuries had been reported. Ramlall said yesterday afternoon they attended to another fire in a CDB building after smoke was seen coming from one of the rooms. He said the source of the smoke was a short circuiting DB box.At about 3.20 am, two Durban Fire vehicles attended a fire at a vehicle assessment centre on Mahatma Gandhi (Point) Road. Jonathan Oberholster  a resident living close to where the fire happened, said he was woken up by the sound of cracking windows.“I thought the sound was not that of a gun and I looked outside and there was the blaze. It was not terrifying but it was be very dramatic."He said about 15 minutes after the fire started, the fire fighters arrived. “The service station had cars parked all the way towards the road and the fire seemed to have started at the back. So the fire guys went in with just hand held equipment and they put the fire out pretty quickly,” he said. Durban Fire divisional commander Alfred Newman said 11 vehicles were well alight when they arrived. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The service centre manager refused to speak to The Mercury saying they were very busy in the aftermath. Newman said they also attended to a small fire on the 16th floor at Addington Hospital. A water leak at the nurses' residency had caused an electrical short circuit. There were no injuries at either fire.
