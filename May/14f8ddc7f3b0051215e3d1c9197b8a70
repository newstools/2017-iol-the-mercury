In its 25th year, taking place from September 15 to 17 at the Hilton College, the festival celebrates sharing the best of South Africa’s magnificent art, theatre, music and crafts, all in one venue. 
This year promises to be no different, with an exciting line up of some of the country’s most sought after art exhibitions.
With a riveting programme of art already secured, potential exhibitors wanting to be a part of this year’s festival have until June 9 to get their applications in.  The closing date for crafters to request a stall area is May 26.
Festival-goers will enjoy a phenomenal exhibition by Matthew Willman, as he brings his astonishing solo exhibition A Life Less Ordinary for us to enjoy some never-before seen images of one of the greatest men to ever live, Nelson Mandela. 
The exhibition details photographic works from Mandela’s birthplace, the infamous Rivonia Trial, life on Robben Island and private moments shared with Mandela during the last 10 years of his retirement.
Festival director Sue Clarence said this year the team is taking art to a whole new level. 
“The festival has secured the opportunity to showcase the work of legendary Italian film director and screenwriter, Federico Fellini. We will also be hosting a selection of his drawings and movies as one of the festival highlights this year,” she said.
