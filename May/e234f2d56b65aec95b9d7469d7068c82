The incident took place on Thursday night at about 7pm when police officers were escorting murder suspect Wiseman Nguse, 40, to verify his home address at uMlazi's E-section.

Nguse faced a murder charge for the death of Sandile Dladla, 25, whose body was found decomposed in uMlazi's E section informal settlement last week. 

Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said about 200 members of the community gathered before approaching the police, who were attacked, along with their police vehicle. 

"They overpowered police officers and forcefully removed the suspect who was in their custody. Residents assaulted the suspect with sticks, stones and bush knives before he was set alight," said Zwane. 

Police are now investigating a case of murder, assault and malicious damage to property. No arrests have been made. 

KZN's acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, condemned the action of the community and said it was unacceptable. 

“It is totally unacceptable that someone is killed merely because he was a suspect. Police were following the necessary route to establish the deceased’s guilt or innocence. Even if there was sufficient evidence against him, he was entitled to his day in court to defend himself. Mob justice is a dangerous practice and can result in many innocent people being killed to satisfy certain individuals need for blood to be spilt. We will ensure that those who attacked our police officers and killed the suspect receive affair trail, a right which was denied to the deceased,” he said.
