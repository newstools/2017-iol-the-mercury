Proudly South African yesterday announced that it has developed an innovative, in-house tender tracking system to monitor the government’s compliance with its own mandate to make local procurement a priority. Proudly SA’s chief executive Eustace Mashimbye said the system would trawl the websites of all three spheres of government, their agencies and entities, giving the IT team full access to the terms of reference of all Request For Quotes and Request For Proposals.
