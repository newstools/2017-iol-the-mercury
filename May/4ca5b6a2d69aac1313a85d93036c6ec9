There have been no arrests in connection with the bomb which went off in suburban Durban on Friday.
Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, spokesperson for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (The Hawks), said on Sunday that it was “still too early”.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“The matter was only referred to us late on Friday,” he said. But he said investigations were “going well”.
He declined to divulge any details about the investigation but said charges of attempted murder and contravening the explosives act had been opened.
Three people were injured in the attack, which took place at around 12.30pm at a mansion in Stephen Dlamini (formerly Essenwood) Road, Musgrave.
It is understood that the bomb was hidden in a parcel, with flowers and a “get well” card that was delivered to the home.
When those living there opened the parcel, it exploded.
A second bomb was later found at the home and police detonated it in a controlled explosion.
The Mercury's sister paper, The Sunday Tribune, reported yesterday that the injured were Zakaria, Sara-Bibi and Maseeha Khan.
The paper reported that Zakaria was in an induced coma following brain surgery, and that two of the family's cars had been torched on previous occasions.
Family spokesperson Nawshaadh Khan said yesterday that Zakaria was still in intensive care.
He added that the family was still “very traumatised” and that they were in the process of arranging counselling.
