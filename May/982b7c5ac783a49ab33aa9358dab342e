Apricot and cardamom bread and butter pudding (Serves 4)I blame my Nordic roots for my obsession with cardamom. It works its magic with apricots in this divine and creamy bread and butter pudding. Be sure to seek out plump green cardamom pods with aromatic black seeds inside. 10 fat green cardamom pods, peeled and crushed to give ¾ tsp350ml  regular or double cream, plus extra to serve, if wished150ml milk100g sugar (caster or granulated), plus 1 tbsp3 eggs, beaten1 tsp vanilla extract50g dried apricots, chopped50ml boiling water6 slices of white bread, crusts removed (slightly stale if possible)30g soft butterPlace the crushed cardamom seeds in a saucepan with the cream, milk and 100g of sugar. Stir over a high heat as it comes up to the boil and make sure the sugar dissolves. Once it comes to boiling point, turn off the heat and set aside for 2 minutes. Put the beaten eggs and vanilla extract in a bowl, then pour over the cream mixture, whisking all the time.Next, place the chopped apricots in a cup or heatproof bowl and pour the boiling water over them. Set the apricots aside to plump up while you butter the bread.Lay the bread out on your worktop and butter it with the soft butter. Cut the slices into 12 triangles. Lay 6 triangles of bread in the bottom of a 1 litre pie dish, buttered-side up. Drain the plumped apricots then scatter them over the bread. Arrange the remaining triangles in a chevron design over the apricots. Add the cream and egg mixture, then sprinkle with the 1 tablespoon sugar and set aside for 1 hour if possible (or overnight).Preheat the oven to 180C and place a bain marie of steaming water in the middle of the oven (a roasting tin half full with boiling water). Place the pie dish in the tin and cook for 1 hour or until golden and puffed. Allow to cool slightly, then serve with softly whipped cream.Recipes From My Mother by Rachel Allen is available on Loot.co.za for R299. Click here to purchaseDaily Mail
