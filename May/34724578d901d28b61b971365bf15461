A man had to be rescued when a muddy embankment collapsed at a home in Port Edward on Monday.Alan Stilwell, NSRI Port Edward duty controller, said: “At midday on Monday I stopped at my residence front gate after returning from the shops when I noticed a commotion and a mass of water flowing through my neighbour’s garden.“On closer inspection I found neighbours and workers attempting to assist a labourer who was stuck in a muddy embankment up to his knees in water and sludge.”He said it appeared that the worker and colleagues were shovelling earth at the base of an earth face exposure when the embankment collapsed on to an exposed municipal main water feeder line causing a flood of water and the embankment to collapse.A 49-year-old worker from a local plumbing company was trapped.Colleagues were trying to free him but, said, Stilwell, despite their best efforts he sunk deeper into a hole up to his waist. Concerned that the situation would escalate, Stilwell called for help.“I activated our NSRI Port Edward duty crew to come to assist and NSRI Port Edward, the SAPS Police Search and Rescue and Medivac ambulance services responded.”The man was extricated and he and his 33-year-old brother were transported to hospital in stable conditions for a medical examination. Stilwell said both were expected to fully recover.
