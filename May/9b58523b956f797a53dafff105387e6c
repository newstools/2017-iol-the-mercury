The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) has announced that new road closures are in place for this year’s race, due to the change of finish venue. The world famous marathon takes place this year on Sunday, June 4, 2017. The up run race starts at 5.30am outside Durban City Hall and finishes 12 hours later at the Scottsville Racecourse. CMA Race Director, Rowyn James has confirmed the following road closures for Comrades weekend, June 3 and 4. James asked that residents in the finish venue precinct take note as certain roads in the last 7km of the route will be most affected by the closure. “Road closures will take effect from the top of Polly Shortts to CB Downes Road (R103) direction Pietermaritzburg, as well as Gladys Manzi Road (previously Murray Road) and Cleland Road. Blackburrow Road, Fairfield Avenue, Ridge Road, New England Road, Harwin Road and Taylor Street will also be affected,” said James. He said the Comrades Team had dropped off notices at homes and businesses along the affected route. “We greatly value the co-operation of all residents.
