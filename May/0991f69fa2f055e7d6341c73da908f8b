Be prepared to laugh your socks off with comedy
giants, Masood Boomgaard, Richelieu Beaunoir, Mo Vawda and Neil Green as they take
to the stage.

“Sydenham has a reputation for producing
some of the funniest people around and now three of the most hilarious
comedians ever to come out of the “Nimz”, and their friends, will be uniting
for a homecoming show that is sure to be a night of none stop laughter,” said show
host Boomgaard. 

Boomgaard has been apart of the comedy
scene for more than a decade, appearing in solo shows and touring the country.
He is also a viral video star having amassed a combined two million views on
Youtube and Facebook. He most recently appeared in the show “Joker.”

Another star attraction will be Richelieu
Beaunoir, a regular on Comedy Central, appearing alongside the biggest names in
local and international comedy. Known for his exemplary crowd interaction and
ability to deliver gags off the cuff, Richelieu recently was crowned Comedy
Central Africa’s Roast champion in the recent inaugural competition.

Neil Green known as the thinking man’s
comedian will also feature in the lineup. Arguably one of the most respected
comedians in the country, Green has a style of his own and almost always has
audiences rolling in the aisles with laughter.

Also expect great performances from up and
comers like Mo Vawda and others.

“Bechet has a special place in the hearts
of the residents of Sydenham and Durban at large. I am really excited to be
part of this event. We urge everyone to come out and support home grown comedy
and the school,” said Boomgaard.

The Nimz Sydenham Comedy Jam takes place on
May 19 at 8pm at Bechet High School, 34 Barnes Road, Sydenham.
