Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele told The Mercury that at 1am on Monday, there had been a shooting at the Burnwood informal settlement, where a sleeping couple was “attacked and shot by the known suspect”. 

“They sustained gunshot wounds on the leg, thigh and arm."

She said the bullet also grazed another resident in the area. 

"The injured victims were taken to hospital for medical attention. 

The suspect fled the scene and the police are searching for him.”

After the shooting at 6am the community embarked on a protest at the corners of Stanley Copley and Randles Road in Sydenham, demanding the suspect leave the area. 

“They blockaded the road with burning tyres and trees. They also stoned the police vehicles. Police are at the scene to stabilise the situation. The Sydenham SAPS management is addressing the community members.”
