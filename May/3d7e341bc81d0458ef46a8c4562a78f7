Commuters battled traffic chaos as taxis blockaded major roads as part of their strike action.

The Business Report said that the South Africa National Taxi Council (Santaco) spokesperson Thabisho Molelekwa said on Tuesday the industry in KwaZulu-Natal had confirmed it would embark on protest action against Toyota and would “blockade all entries to the manufacturer's plant in Durban”.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Molelekwa said in the article that the action was scheduled to start with a blockade at Toyota SA’s plant.

The car manufacturer said it expected the protest to take the form of a “legally sanctioned” peaceful march.

In the same article, Suben Moodley, TSAM senior vice-president corporate affairs, said the company had been informed on Tuesday morning that permission had been granted by the eThekwini municipality for a march to Toyota SA’s premises.

“Since this is a legally sanctioned march, we understand that both the SAPS and metro (police) will be present.

“Toyota has not requested any presence by the SAPS. We believe this will be a peaceful march,” he said.

Meanwhile, commuters and motorists took to social media to share their frustrations.
