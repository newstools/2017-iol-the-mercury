Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the arrests were made by the Richards Bay Organised Crime unit who tracked the suspect to the Ingwavuma area where he was hiding. 

Mbuyazi was living with albinism and had gone missing on Wednesday last week before her naked body was found in bushes at the Ndlabeyilandula area in KwaMbonambi, two days later. 

"She had stab wounds on her body and without her underwear which made police to suspect that she was raped. A case of rape and murder was opened at KwaMbonambi police station," said Zwane.

"The members were looking for the suspect immediately after a murder case was opened at the KwaMbonambi police station. He will be charged with rape and murder and will appear in the KwaMbonambi Magistrates’ Court soon," said Zwane.
KwaZulu-Natal's acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the police: “We once again condemn the killing of people living with albinism in the province. I must commend our detectives and uniformed members who worked tirelessly immediately once the victim was reported missing. Our detectives will meticulously investigate this case and ensure that the suspect is prosecuted and convicted".
