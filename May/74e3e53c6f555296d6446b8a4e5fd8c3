The MEC for Community Safety, Mxolisi Kaunda, on Wednesday afternoon confirmed that cases were opened.
He said missing person reports were filed and cases of attempted kidnapping were opened.
It is believed that these cases were opened on Tuesday, following a stakeholder engagement.
Kaunda said an investigation into whether or not people who tried to open cases earlier, were prevented from doing so was underway.
Violent attacks on foreign nationals erupted in KwaMashu earlier this week.
Shops were looted, a number of people were injured and one person died.
Locals said the foreign nationals were behind the kidnappings.
But police repeatedly called the reports of kidnappings, fake and said no cases had been opened.
Schoolchildren also took to the streets of the township on Tuesday following violent riots and the looting of foreign national-owned shops in the north Durban township the night before.
