Police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the bust to The Mercury on Thursday.
Police stopped the vehicle and searched it, finding a false compartment on its loading area.
The officers found 145 parcels weighing 1kg each.
The total bust is estimated to be worth R101 million.
“Two men and one woman have been arrested,” said Mbhele, adding that several units – including the crime and intelligence unit – were involved in the bust.
There have been several other drug busts across the country by police this year.
In January this year, a 58-year-old man was arrested after dagga and other drugs worth about R1 million was seized from his Durban home, police said.
The joint operation by the Hawks, eThekwini Crime Intelligence, and Durban Metro Police found 150kg of compressed dagga, benzine, and magic mushrooms after a raid at the home in the New Germany area.
Over more than a month – since the start of February – at least 120 busts were made in the Western Cape.
These resulted in the arrest of 336 people in that province.
