DURBAN - With slithery snake moments from Durban going global online this week, snake experts have warned that residents must be on the look-out this weekend as not only are the busy reptiles feeding and sunning before winter, but it is also mating season.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Topping social media shares across the world was the massive black mamba in Westville, Durban, which was cosying up to the owner’s bed before sliding in the wardrobe and the large python who was spotted lazily cruising between holes at the Zimbali Golf Course.
Local snake catcher, Jason Arnold said there is normally “a hype of activity” by the slippery reptiles at this time of year as winter is just around the corner.
“They are trying to get food and to sit in the sun as much as possible, especially ahead of a cold front such as this weekend as they sense it’s coming. 
“Once the cold hits they will go and hide, but when seeking shelter they will look for a warm place and that tends to be people’s homes, garages and wendy houses,” said Arnold.
He said black mambas mating season can continue into July, while the mating season for green mambas is May and June. Mambas can grow up to an estimated three metres in length and green mambas are smaller, growing up to two metres. 


Herpetologist, Nick Evans from KZN Amphibian and Reptile Conservation who was called in to catch the two and half metre long mamba from the cupboard in the Westville house confirmed on Friday that the snake was released back into the wild on Thursday.
