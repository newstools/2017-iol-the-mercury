KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo said that as of last Wednesday the province had lost 93 rhinos, while arrests of alleged poachers were made at the weekend.
“The 10 were discovered on Friday, May 12. They, however, had been killed on different days. Some carcasses were four weeks old while others were 12 hours old.” 
One of the animals had died naturally.
“Eight were poached in iMfolozi section of the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, while the one other had been poached in the Hluhluwe section. 
“Two men were arrested on Friday night and Saturday morning, and we confiscated a .375 rifle, a Toyota Corolla and a silencer. Tests are still being done to determine if the equipment confiscated is linked to any of the nine rhinos poached.”
Meanwhile, Ezemvelo on Monday auctioned 1 183 animals – including ostrich, nyala, antelope and waterbuck – in a game auction. The auction raked in R8.1 million.
Also last week, Sars Customs intercepted a consignment of rhino horn worth R1.7m at OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. 
The bust, said Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela, followed on the heels of 7kg of rhino horn intercepted last Thursday.
“The discovery was made when customs officials scanned a box and detected images consistent with rhino horn. 
"Nine rhino horns, cut into different sizes and weighing 13.2kg, were found. The consignment was en route to Hong Kong.”
