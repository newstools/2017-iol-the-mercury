Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said that on Tuesday, police were conducting an intelligence operation in Nquthu, in northern KZN, when they received information on an imminent supermarket heist.
“Six suspects in three vehicles were spotted and immediately arrested. Police also recovered a firearm, with its serial number filed off,” Zwane said, “Investigations led police to Katlehong, in Gauteng, where a suspect - found with a firearm in his possession - was arrested as an accomplice to the six suspects already in police custody”
Extensive investigations linked the suspects to a bank robbery, in Nquthu, in July, as well as a supermarket hold up, in Newcastle.
“Police also discovered that the suspects were planning to rob two more supermarkets, in Nquthu and Nkandla,” Zwane said, “The suspects will be profiled to determine if they can be linked to other business robberies in the country”.
The men are facing charges of possession of illegal firearms and business robbery and will appear in court soon.
