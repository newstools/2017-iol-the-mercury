Married to multi-platinum recording artist, songwriter and producer Kid Ink

Asiah, the youngest woman in the circle of friends, is working to find the balance in her life between having fun and being responsible.  She’s faced with figuring out how to juggle all of her responsibilities as of her career and being a mom to her daughter with husband, Kid Ink.  Asiah is a loyal friend and expects the same from others, but she continues to butt heads with Crystal over past unresolved issues.

Alycia Bella

Newly single Alycia Bella is a singer, actress, aspiring DJ and all around firecracker.  With looks that could kill and a seemingly sweet demeanour, don't let her fool you as while she's made it known that she's respectful, she'll come for you if you send for her.  Being the only single one of the group adds to the stress but Alycia is trying to date through trial and error.

Married to Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and producer Eric Bellinger

La’Myia has a lot on her plate right now.  She’s busy managing her career, balancing her philanthropy, being a mom and keeping the romance red hot with her husband Eric Bellinger.  Unlike some of the other women, La’Myia has been in the entertainment industry since the age of seven along with her sister, actress Meagan Good.  She has an unapologetic personality and confronts issues head on, especially when it comes to her best friend Crystal.

In a relationship with Grammy Award-winning rapper, singer, songwriter and producer Nelly

Now in a relationship with Nelly, Shantel finally feels like they are united and in a great place together.  Nelly just purchased a new home in Los Angles for the two of them, and has been hinting to Shantel that having a baby would be a great next step in their relationship.  However, Shantel is more focused on taking her career to the next level and wants to put babies on hold.

In a relationship with rapper, songwriter and producer, King Los

After being nominated for Best Female Hip Hop Artist at the BET Awards, Lola Monroe took a 3-year hiatus from the spotlight in order to be super-mom to son Brixton.  Now, Lola wants to get things back on track with her career and take the music industry by storm.  Stakes are at an all-time high as this comeback is a “make or break” time for her.  With that in mind, her long-time boyfriend King Los will now have to take on some of her household and parenting duties.

Married to Multi-Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor, NE-YO

Crystal is married to NE-YO, but as the newest member to "The Platinum Life" lifestyle, Crystal still has a lot to learn.  She seems determined to buck the rules and live life exactly how she wants to live it.  While Crystal’s unfiltered  point of view definitely ruffles some feathers within the group, she is laser-focused on her cooking channel and taking her business to the next level.

The Platinum Life is produced by STXtv and Tower 2 Productions with Ryan Holcomb, Jason Goldberg, Shanta Conic, and Kim McKoy serving as executive producers.
