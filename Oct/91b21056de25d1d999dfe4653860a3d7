Eshowe SAPS members acted on intelligence driven information, which led them to the Nkanini area in Eshowe, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Thulani Zwane.
 
He said when SAPS arrived at the house they conducted a search, which identified motor vehicle engine parts in the garage. An engine was found to be one of a vehicle stolen in Pinetown in September. Other car parts found on the premises were confiscated.
 
Zwane said the woman was charged for being in possession of stolen property and appeared in the Eshowe Magistrate’s Court.
In another incident, on Monday night, the uMhlali K9, KwaDukuza SAPS and security companies conducted a sting operation in Doringkop, Uthekela.
 
The raid recovered two suspected stolen vehicles in a house - a blue Toyota Yaris as well as a grey Toyota Verso.
 
Further investigations revealed that the Yaris was stolen in Brighton Beach earlier this month, and the Verso, in February at the Point Area, Durban.
 
Two suspects aged 21 and 42 were arrested for possession of stolen property at the KwaDukuza SAPS. The two will appear in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court this week, once charged.
 
KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the members for the recovery of stolen vehicles.
