A sewage spill at the Durban marina – which began last week and worsened at the weekend – is still being cleaned up.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The Point Yacht Club (PYC) was one of the properties affected, and said that the problem started last week, and steadily progressed into the weekend.
The spill is reported to have affected a canal known as “Lavender Creek”.
The club’s members said that they saw faecal matter, pieces of toilet roll and sanitary pads floating in the water. They then alerted the authorities.
The water, they said, seemed "milky" and the colour of weak tea.

News of the incident had been circulated to the club’s members via Whatsapp.
The message said: “Please be aware that due to pump station failures during the recent periods of rain, there has been a huge inflow of sewage through Lavender Creek, and the entire marina area was a disgusting cesspool over the weekend ... There were teams pouring peroxide and chemicals into the creek on Saturday. 
It is recommended to stay off the water until the water quality has improved significantly.”
