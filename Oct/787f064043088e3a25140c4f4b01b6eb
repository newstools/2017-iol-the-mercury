A Netcare911 paramedic who helped deliver a baby in a taxi earlier this year, has safely delivered another baby, this time at a KwaMashu home. Elmi Changuion responded with partner Mohamed Siddeeq Mahomed when Netcare was called in to assist a woman in labour.Spokesman Nick Dollman said they realised she was too far along and wasn’t going to make it to the hospital so they helped her give birth.“The baby was full term, they cleaned her, cut her cord and checked that everything was fine before transporting mother and baby to the hospital.”In May, Elmi Changuion was partnered with Sibongiseni Walter Molife when they were called out to assist with a delivery in a taxi on the M13 next to the St Johns bridge on-ramp in Pinetown.“The pregnant 31-year-old woman went into labour unexpectedly while commuting in the minibus taxi. The driver was made aware of the situation and he pulled over to the middle island. "RTI traffic officers who were stationed nearby went to investigate and were told of the situation.They knew that Netcare 911 paramedics were stationed nearby so one rushed to their location to call for help,” said Dollman. Changuion and Molife were on scene within two minutes. “There was no time to move the mom to the ambulance and the minibus taxi was emptied to create space and privacy. The Netcare 911 team safely delivered the baby in the taxi before moving mom and her little girl to the ambulance. Although the baby was premature, both patients were in a stable condition and were transported to hospital,” he said.
