The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has laid criminal charges against suspended Eskom executive Matshela Koko related to irregularities, corruption and fraud and his alleged close relationship with the Gupta family. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
In a statement released on Thursday morning, Outa said it had laid the charges with reference to the State of Capture report, compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and emails contained in the so called Guptaleaks.
“We have built a solid case against Koko with evidence of misconduct in his role as an Eskom executive and his relationship with the Guptas,” said Ben Theron, Outa Chief Operating Officer.
Koko and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.
Koko has held several positions in Eskom. In December 2016, he was appointed as interim CEO and prior to that he was the executive in charge of generation which includes oversight of coal contracts.
The organisation alleges that Koko used his position at Eskom to help the Guptas buy Optimum Coal Holdings and its Optimum and Koornfontein coal mines from Glencore, by helping put those businesses under financial pressure to force the sale to the Guptas and helping fund the Guptas’ purchase. It is also alleged that in 2016 he took a trip to Dubai which was paid for by the Gupta family.
In May this year, Koko was placed on special leave pending an investigation when it was revealed that a company at which his stepdaughter was a director at netted at least R1 billion in contracts from Eskom in just 11 months.
