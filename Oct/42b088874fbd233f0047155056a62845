Craft beer lovers, get ready for a massive brew-filled day as Umhlanga’s first October Beer Festival hits town at Granada Square, on Chartwell Drive, today. Marketing director of Goldfish Communications Karen Welgemoed said the main aim was to create a fun and exciting event in the heart of the Umhlanga Village that can become an annual event, and can grow into the future.“October Beer Festival is a way for us to add to the vibe of Granada Square, and we will look at hosting this as an annual event, eventually to have it as an entire weekend-long event with different forms of entertainment as the event grows”, she said.“When patrons arrive they will be given a free beer glass and two beer tokens, which can be used for wine, soft drinks or food on offer from Angelo’s, Pinxtxada or Little Havana. "The open air environment will create a great beer festival atmosphere, complete with beer maidens in traditional attire. Long beer hall tables and hay bales have been provided as part of the décor, and the entertainment includes a DJ and beer pong games,” said Welgemoed.This inaugural festival will be bringing in six locally brewed beer brands, which will be on offer, plus a chance to learn a few of the ropes of brewed beer while you are at it.Tasmin Hewitt and Shaina Krummik.While on your rounds you can also grab a bite and indulge in some delicious food on offering, including ½ Eisbein and sauerkraut (2 tokens), ½ footlong Brockwurst with relish and onions (1 token, or 2 tokens for a full meal), pulled chicken on sourdough (1 token), apple strudel (1 token), German Lasagna (2 tokens) and German gnocchi with chorizo (2 tokens). The event will run from 4pm until 11pm.Tickets are available through zapper and web-tickets at a cost of only R125 per person with strictly no under 18s.
