“Two men were found lying outside the vehicle while a third was found further up the road.
The man had apparently left the scene in an attempt to call for help.”
He said in a statement that paramedics had assessed the men and found that all three had sustained numerous gunshot wounds, leaving them in a critical condition.
“The men were treated for their injuries and provided with advanced life support interventions. 
The men were thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for urgent care.”
