MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo announced the development at a media briefing at the St Mary’s Catholic Mission Hospital in Mariannhill west of Durban on Monday morning.
This is also the hospital being taken over by the department. 
He said the R166 million purchase price was negotiated down to R142 million and while this would be paid over time, the department had taken over operations since October 1. 
“The department has signed a rental lease agreement ... This will last until the buying process is completed,” said Dhlomo. 
Regarding how this was achieved while the department itself was having financial woes which led to intervention from Treasury, Dhlomo said the decision to take over St Mary’s was endorsed by the provincial cabinet. 
He said the takeover of St Mary’s would be part of the process which the department was being guided through by Treasury staff who were brought in to assist with the “very weak” financial management and supply chain processes.
