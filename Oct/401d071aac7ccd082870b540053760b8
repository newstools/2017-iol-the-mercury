Nine were taken to hospital. Most of those treated were discharged on Saturday night. The BBC reported that Saturday's incident on Exhibition Road initially sparked panic in an area popular with families and tourists.Armed police were deployed and video footage quickly emerged showing a man, believed to be the driver, being restrained on the ground.However, the Met later said its inquiry was "entirely a road traffic investigation".
