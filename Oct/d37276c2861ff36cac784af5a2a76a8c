Durban - A man at a petrol station was taking no chances with safety
when he blasted a smoking customer with a fire extinguisher.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The incident resulted in a row at the garage as the man with the fire extinguisher –
assumed to be an owner or petrol attendant - argued with the smoker.

In the video footage, believed to have been shot in
Bulgaria, two cars pull up at a petrol station in the middle of the night.

A young man in one of the cars then proceeds to light up
while standing just outside his vehicle on the driver’s side. The driver of the second vehicles waits for service.

After a few seconds another man appears in the picture and
reaches down and grabs the fire extinguisher.

He then fiddles for a bit before blasting the stunned smoker
with a full blast of the fire retardant. A second man lurches out of the
vehicle as a cloud of grey smoke envelops the forecourt of the garage.

Gesticulations are seen on both sides as they argue about
the incident.
