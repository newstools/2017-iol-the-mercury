 In a video circulating on social media, the gang arrive in a white Mercedes Benz seconds after the woman parked her car outside her property. Two men, one armed with a crowbar, alight from their car and approach the Cherry Lane resident. At the point the woman is standing next to her car. When the men walk up to her, she gets back into the car and they pull her out. The woman grabs the crowbar and swings at one of them. The attackers flee and the woman hits their getaway car with the crowbar. 

The woman’s neighbours come to her aid as the gang drive off. 

Speaking to the Daily News, a neighbour said crime was a common occurrence in Cherry Lane. He said he was inside when heard the woman screaming outside. By the time he arrived, the men fled and the woman was not harmed.

 Chris Pappas, ward councillor for the area said as per 2015/2016 crime statistics, released earlier this week, there has been a spike in car jackings and house robberies in the Berea. 

“Despite the best efforts of the SAPS there are huge challenges in terms of resources; manpower and appropriate vehicles. Councillors are also tied in this regard as SAPS does not fall within the mandate of local government which means we have no authority on this regard,” he said. 

Pappas said while individual acts of bravery are inspiring he urged residents not to put themselves in harm's way.

“Possessions can be replaced, lives cannot,” Pappas said.
