They said in a statement that teams from Durban, Shelly Beach and Port Edward had been fully deployed assisting at floods in and around the Kwa-Zulu-Natal North and South Coast.
The service assisted emergency services to evacuate people trapped in vehicles, homes and businesses.
Babies, children and adults were all moved to higher ground from flash flooded areas.
They also assisted in the recovery of a craft, which had broken from moorings on the Umtamvuna River.
“At Montclair and at Isipingo, initially the main concentration of NSRI’s assistance, has seen a baby rescued from an entrapment in a home and many incidents of residents and motorists being assisted to higher ground and away from flooded areas and entrapments.”
The Durban team dispatched their sea rescue vehicle and rescue swimmers in wet suits.
They said the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) were dealing with the container ship that had drifted into the mouth of the Port of Durban and other vessels and boats beached on sand banks.
“Yachts and boats in the small craft harbour and at the Point Yacht Club (PYC) have broken moorings. NSRI Durban rescue crews are at PYC assisting to corral boats and yachts broken free of moorings.”
