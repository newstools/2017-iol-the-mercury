“We can expect lots of rainfall in KZN today, more especially along the coast with widespread showers. There is a warning for heavy rain in some parts of the province. This will mainly affect the coast and adjacent parts. The system is still moving. There may be a peak of sunshine later today or early tomorrow. It is expected to clear a little by Wednesday with Thursday being a fine and warmer day,” Vermeulen said.
He added that there is another cold front expected to hit the KZN again by the weekend. 
Ethekwini Municipality Disaster teams have confirmed that they are on standby.
