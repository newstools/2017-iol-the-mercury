Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident at the Ballito Junction Mall and said that the man had been arrested and taken into custody.
IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said that the woman – believed to be in her mid- to late 20s and from the area – had been declared dead at the scene.
“We arrived to find that the woman’s throat had been slit. It was too late, so she was declared deceased.”
Reports from the scene indicate that the woman had been the victim of a domestic dispute.
It is believed that her ex-boyfriend visited her at her place of employment.
The pair then allegedly went to a restaurant, where she left to go to the bathroom, with the man following her in.
Two shoppers – believed to be students – were in the bathroom stalls when they heard the woman scream.
They then allegedly found her with her throat slit and bleeding profusely.
The students and cleaner began screaming as the suspect ran out of the bathroom.
Two other shoppers intervened and caught the suspect, managing to subdue him until mall security and police arrived.
