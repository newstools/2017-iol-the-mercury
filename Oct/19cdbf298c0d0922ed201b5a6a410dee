Durban - DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango is considering legal action against the police after his four young children were left traumatised when a group of heavily armed police officers pointed R5 rifles at him. The incident happened at Nongoma, Mncwango’s home town, on Thursday afternoon.  Mncwango said he first realised a white, unmarked minibus taxi was flashing blue lights at him. “I was driving at about 40/50 km/h as there were other cars in front of me.” He said as soon as he pulled over to the side of the road, about six officers alighted from the unmarked minibus pointing their rifles at him. “They were very rude, asking me why I did not have bodyguards. I told them not to point the guns at me and one of them said an R5 rifle has to be carried that way as it cannot be held pointing down.” Mncwango said one of the police officers took pictures of his car. In the car he had his wife and four kids, including the youngest who is six-weeks-old.  Mncwango said he had reported the matter to the Acting Provincial Commissioner.  “I will also be consulting with my lawyer to see what action one can take. It is not about the status but no one deserves such treatment,” he said. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala said Mncwango should report the incident at a police station, "so that the allegations can be investigated".The Mercury
