The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) said via their Facebook page last week that teams from their organisation and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife made the decision to bring the animal to the rehabilitation center at uShaka Sea World. 
"She was lethargic, very thin and one of her hind flippers appeared to be injured."
The animal health team took X-rays, administered antibiotics and placed her in her own private rehabilitation pool.

"She is now eating well, swimming in her pool and endlessly grooming herself. She is described by her caregivers as both curious and relaxed, and a pleasure to work with."
Lead animal behaviourist Hayley Tennant said: “She is the first stranded seal I have worked with who ate the food I held out to her within a day of being admitted. Taking food so early in her journey to full recovery means that she will start gaining weight and we are able to administer medication to her in her food – this makes life so much easier.”
