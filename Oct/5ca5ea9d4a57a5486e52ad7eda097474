Private company Marshall Security said in a statement that they had been alerted to reports of a house being broken into shortly after 5am.
The incident took place at a home in Wincantan Way in the suburb of Somerset Park, north of Durban. 
“Reports from the scene suggest that an unknown number of suspects forced entry into the home by removing a window, before stealing a flat screen television, unlocking the security gate, and stealing the chain and lock and fleeing on foot.”
Armed reaction officers, they said, combed the area along with police officers.
“A suspect was found in Somerset Park Drive in possession of the stolen television.” 
They said that three other suspects had been seen fleeing towards a getaway vehicle, and the other suspect arrested had been found in possession of the lock and chain from the premises. 
“His accomplices remain at large. “
