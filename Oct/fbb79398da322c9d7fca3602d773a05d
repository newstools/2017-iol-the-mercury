Video: Supplied
The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Basic Education on Sunday morning revealed that it had been made aware of the video but it was not immediately clear whether or not it had originated from within the province.
Spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said investigations to establish the school at which it was filmed, were underway.
"We have not been able to identify the school. It’s very difficult because the video is very short,” Mthethwa said, “We just hope it’s not a KZN school”.
Last month, a video – apparently of corporal punishment being administered at a KwaZulu-Natal school – emerged on Facebook, leaving members of the public shocked.
