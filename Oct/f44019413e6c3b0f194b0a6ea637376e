According to the SAPS crime statistics, released in Parliament on Tuesday morning, there were 4014 murders reported in the province from April 2016 to March 2017.

This reflects an increase from the 3929 incident reported during the same period in the previous year.

KZN had the second highest number of murders after Gauteng, where there were 4101.

Acting Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba told parliament that 8% of the murders in KZN during the period could be attributed to mob violence or vigilantism and that 1.9% of the reported murders were linked to taxi violence 

“Hostel violence was identified as a generator of murder in KZN, with 0.6% of the murders in the province attributed to this phenomenon,” he added.

Mothiba also said the abuse of alcohol and drugs was found to still be a generator of violent crime in the country and in KZN.

“Alcohol was one of the generators of murder in 18.5% of the murders sampled,” he said, “Furthermore the province reported that 41 murders were reported on Christmas Day 2016 and a further 47 murders were reported on New Years’ Day”.

Mothiba said these were normally days where people were involved in high alcohol consumption and that the figures could be linked to this.
