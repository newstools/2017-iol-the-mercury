They said in a statement: “The inclement weather is also expected to disrupt operations at the Port of Richards Bay. Transnet’s marine services team and tugboats are assisting with several emergencies.”
These, they said, included the grounding of three vessels in the Port of Durban. 
“Other vessels have broken mooring lines and are drifting in the channel. Whilst we are still in the process of determining damage to port infrastructure. Several TNPA premises have been flooded including the Transnet Maritime School of Excellence in Bayhead Road.”
Terminal and rail operations had also been suspended to ensure the safety of people and equipment. 
“We have assured all stakeholders of our urgent attention and allocation of resources to address these challenges. We will continue to monitor the situation closely via Port Control and the Harbour Masters’ offices, and will keep stakeholders updated.”
