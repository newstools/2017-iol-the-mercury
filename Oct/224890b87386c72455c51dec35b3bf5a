When Sharks captain Ruan Botha held baby Jorden for the first time, the gentle giant thought he’d break him!ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads“He just seemed so small and fragile, in the week that we’ve had him home, I’ve learnt how to hold him gently, without fear of dropping or harming him.”It was important to Botha that he was present when his wife gave birth to their first child at Alberlito Hospital on October 16.“I wanted to be by her side the entire time,” he said.“We all were emotional at birth, he was just so perfect.”Monene was so strong throughout the birthing process, Botha said. After she had recovered and was ready and in control, she told him to go and train and focus on “winning the Currie Cup”. “She is my number one supporter, motivator and is more than just a wife or mother.”Asked if he wished for baby Jorden to be a Shark one day, Botha said all he wanted was for his son to be whatever God planned for him. More importantly, he would teach his son to serve God.An excited Botha, described holding baby Jorden as being the best feeling that both he and Monene had ever experienced, especially since Jorden is the first grandchild in both families.According to Botha, “The most important thing is to be an excellent father to my son, an even better husband to my wife.“For Saturday’s game, baby Jorden will definitely be dressed in Black and White even though he will probably be sleeping through the game,” Botha laughed.The Sharks giant continued that he would always have a soft spot for his wife and son - but warned his opponents that when he crossed the white lines, “it’s game on”. The Mercury is urging fans to get behind The Sharks by wearing Black and White on Friday in support of #BlackandWhiteFriday.
