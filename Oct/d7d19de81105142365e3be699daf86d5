He was speaking after armed gunman tried to force their way into the home of the department's acting head of department Jerry Mfusi this past weekend. 
They opened fire at the security guards working at the house and seriously wounded one guard.
“These people are demanding tenders by force. We will continue to work with the police until such time as those people are caught because we will never allow for a situation where we are dictated to by criminals,” he said.
The IFP provincial spokesperson on Agriculture Nhlanhla Msimango said Mthembu and Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda needed to take steps to urgently improve security for the acting head.
“Mfusi deserves to be protected because he is in charge of a department with a R2.197 billion budget and the Department of Agriculture is where many people expect to get tenders,” he said. 
SAPS spokesperson in the Midlands Mthokozisi Ngobese said they were taking the threats against the department head very seriously.
