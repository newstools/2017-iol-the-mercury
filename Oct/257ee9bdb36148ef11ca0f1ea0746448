Chinese diplomats got the fright of their lives when a rhino charged towards them during a game drive at Thula Thula Private Game Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal.  Although just 8 years old, the rhino, named Thabo, already weighs more than two tons.  The dust lifted as Thabo barrelled down the road towards two game-viewing vehicles ferrying members of the Chinese consulate in Durban, and the South African KwaZulu-Natal Chinese Community.  But when Thabo reached the vehicle, he stopped, relaxed and allowed them to pet him. Ruowen Wang was so excited, she got her father Jianzhou Wang, consul-general of China in Durban, to take a photo of her hand afterwards and vowed not to wash it.  “I’m so lucky I got to feel it, it’s just an unforgettable memory,” she said. “I was always told that when a rhino is charging towards you, it’s mad and angry, so I was very afraid, but then when it came over it suddenly stopped and calmed down.” She couldn’t believe the gentle giant allowed the guests to touch it.  The 16-year-old is an avid nature lover and the experience enforced her belief that rhinos should be “protected, respected and loved”.

With the rate at which rhinos are killed for their horn, extinction is a real threat. “I feel extremely sad about it – I couldn’t even imagine that, not only for the rhinos but for any animal. I don’t wish my descendents wouldn’t get to see any of these beautiful creatures,” said Rouwen.  The head ranger at Thula Thula, Andrew Murgatroyd, said this was typical behaviour from Thabo, who enjoys human contact. “He was hand reared from a few months old. We are trying to discourage it, but it’s so difficult; he really loves it.” Thabo and Ntombi are the last two remaining rhinos at Thula Thula. They were brought in as orphans at just 4 and 8 months old, respectively. Although they have been dehorned for their safety and there is a need to wean them from human contact, they are guarded 24 hours a day.   Richard Mncwango, a security guard who used to guard money, now guards the only two remaining rhinos at Thula Thula 24 hours a day. Picture: Nosipho MngomaRichard Mncwango was with them during the visit by the Chinese delegation. “Thabo is playful and he knows these game drive vehicles,” he said. Although Mncwango is familiar with both Thabo and Ntombi, he is always alert.  “Ntombi is calm but when she is scared she becomes aggressive. I was trained to be careful, that although we are used to each other, they are very strong, so what might be a playful nudge to them could hurt me. If they charge, I run, but they take it as our game,” he said. Mncwango spends his days following Thabo and Ntombi, rifle in hand. “Yesterday, we walked along the road and I knew they were going to the main house. That is where they were raised so they miss it,” he said.  His job concerns his family, but they worry less about what the rhinos might do than about what people who hunt them would do. Mncwango believes there still isn’t enough awareness in rural communities about wild animals. “We are either afraid, or think of them as meat or for use in muti, so we kill them. We had our indigenous ways of conservation, but there is a lot we didn’t really understand. “It is unfortunate, but the truth is that it’s mostly local people who used to commit this crime (of rhino poaching), because they are enticed by money. It is difficult for me to point a gun at a person but it’s my job.  “I was told when I came here that my job is not to kill, but to protect, and that is what I do. I protect Thabo and Ntombi, and pray every day it does not cost me or any person or animal their life.”
