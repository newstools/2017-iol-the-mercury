The Public Order Police swooped in Mambula near Kranskop on Thursday and arrested three people while seizing seven illegal firearms. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the operation took place in the early hours. “Members went to a homestead where a suspect was found in possession of three pistols, a rifle and ammunition. The members proceeded to another homestead at the same area where two brothers were arrested after they were found in possession of three rifles and three ammunition,” said Mbhele. The three suspects, aged between 31 and 43, were charged for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunitions. The suspects would be profiled to check if they are linked to robberies and other cases committed in Kranskop and surrounding areas.  The arrested suspects will appear in the Kranskop Magistrate’s Court. Also on Thursday, the Madadeni High Court convicted and sentenced Lindokuhle Mhlongo, 31, and Ndawoyakhe Shabalala, 47, to life for killing a taxi boss in 2013.  “On November 28, 2013 at about 7am, a local taxi owner, Siyabonga Nkabinde, 38, was with a relative when they were ambushed by two armed males at Section 6 near the taxi rank, who fired shots at them, fatally wounding him and injuring the relative.” She said a case of murder and attempted murder was opened at Madadeni police and it was transferred to the Provincial Taxi Task Team for investigation.  “The persistence of the investigating officers to solve the case led to the arrest of the accused and their successful prosecution. Mhlongo and Shabalala were both sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and 10 years for attempted murder.”
