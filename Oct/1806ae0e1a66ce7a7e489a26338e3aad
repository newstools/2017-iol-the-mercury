Durban - Two eThekwini metro police officers are set to answer to claims that they viciously assaulted a woman and called her a “k*****” and a “f****”. A criminal charge levelled against one of the policemen after the 2014 incident, was subsequently withdrawn due to insufficient evidence. But then the woman brought civil action against the municipality and last week, Judge Jacqui Henriques found she had proved her case on a balance of probabilities and ruled that the municipality was liable for 100% of the damages she had suffered. Now the metro police department is instituting disciplinary proceedings against the officers. The acting head of metro police, Commissioner Steve Middleton, on Wednesday confirmed that the department would be addressing the matter internally. “Arising from the (civil) court action, we will institute disciplinary action and then the process will follow its course,” Middleton said yesterday. On the woman’s version of events, she was lost in Pinetown, when a metro police car stopped in front of her and two white policemen got out with their guns drawn. When she got out of her car, one of the policemen punched her in her face and she fell to the ground. He started kicking her and swearing at her, the woman said, and told her he “did not even know whether she was male or female”. A trial to determine quantum has been adjourned.The Mercury
