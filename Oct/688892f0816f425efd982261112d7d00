Minister of Transport, Joe Maswanganyi has announced that South African motorists will pay more in national licensing transaction fees next year, BusinessTech reported. It said in terms of The Road Traffic Management Corporation Act, licensing centres must pay the Road Traffic Management Corporation a transaction fee for each motorist it processes. This is then passed on to the applicant. The fees will increase from R42 to R72 as of February 1 next year. This is a significant increase, as in previous years the fee had gone up a mere R6. This increase will affect South African motorists across the country, with the actual licensing fee differing from province to province. Each province determines its own registration and licence fees which are increased, from time to time, by proclamation in the provincial gazettes. Annual licence fees are assessed on a vehicle’s tare weight with separate scales for different vehicle types. In the Western Cape, for example, a motorcyclist can expect to pay R168 (as of 1 April 2017) for a new licence, while motorists can pay anywhere between R276 (0-250kg) to R21,042 (11 500kg+) to renew their annual licence. Gauteng motorists can expect to pay between R276-R22,776 and R192 for a motorcycle licence. - Source -BusinessTech
