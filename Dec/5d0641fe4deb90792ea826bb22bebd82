Just days before a nationwide campaign to end violence against women and children came to an end, a 25-year-old woman was shot in her Phoenix home by her former boyfriend.
The young woman's 51-year-old mother and a security guard on the premises were also seriously wounded in the shooting at Bridgebury Flats.
Glen Naidoo of private security company KZN VIP Protection said that the suspect, an armed response officer employed by Blue Security, then fatally shot himself in the head. 
"The man is believed to have made his way from Chatsworth on Friday. He had abandoned both his work station and work vehicle and made his way to Phoenix where his former girlfriend lived with her mother."
After a domestic dispute ensued, gunshots sounded off, residents of the flat complex screamed for help and the security guard working within the premises came to offer assistance. He was shot in the stomach by the alleged shooter.
"The alleged shooter then turned the gun on him. Both the woman and alleged shooter were declared dead on the scene. The deceased’s mother and security guard were transported to the nearest hospital for medical care."
Blue Security managing director, Henk Van Bemmelen said the officer had had no criminal record and had not shown any indication of instability in the workplace or prior to the shooting.
December 10 marked the end of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children.
