Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo spread Christmas cheer on Thursday morning, visiting a dying boy after seeing a social media support group. 17-year-old Miso Khoza from Pietermaritzburg who is doing Grade 11 at Maritzburg College is hospitalised at the Hilton Private Hospital with an aggressive form of cancer. His illness is at advance stage and there is a chance he may not see Christmas. “He has an aggressive form of cancer that has affected his mobility, he cannot walk, and now, he cannot move his arms. Even when he speaks he speaks in a very low voice; the doctors have told him that the disease has done extensive damage to his body,” said Njilo. Njilo said it was painful to see a young man suffering so much. “He was already ill when he wrote his exams and was hoping that he would be doing grade 12 next year. He is an active boy involved in many things at the school, including plays."His mother Nqobile Dladla said Miso had been battling cancer for the past few years. And earlier this year it came back stronger, as it was in an area where doctors could not operate, in his collar bone. “Thereafter it started spreading all over his body and in August this year he had to stop the chemotherapy because he was not responding to it.  “Despite all that he is facing, he has remained positive. When he speaks to us he says that it hurts him to see his family in so much pain. He is not angry, his soul is in pain,” said Dladla. “When we spoke, he told me that he was expecting anything to happen to him now and I told him to keep his faith in God, because the God we pray to would never desert him. That is also the message I give to all people in this country,” said Njilo. The mayor was full of praise for  the boy’s mother, for her strength. “She is with him day and night at the hospital, she is a very strong woman and her son is very strong.”
