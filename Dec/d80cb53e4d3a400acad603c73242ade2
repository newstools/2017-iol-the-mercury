More than five tons of nurdles have been collected since their spillage during Durban’s recent disastrous storm.
On October 10, Durban experienced a catastrophic storm, leading to a container ship in Durban Harbour being damaged.
Billions of little plastic pellets, known as nurdles, leaked into the ocean. 
It is estimated that around 49 tons (or billions of pellets) of these nurdles are in the ocean and on KZN beaches.
WILDOCEANS nurdle response co-ordinator Rachel Kramer said in a report collated for the week of November 27 to December 8 that 5.4 tons had so far been collected by all parties combined.

The report included efforts made by the east coast Department of Environmental Affairs, Working for Coast, the formal Directive driven DRIZIT / RESOLVE Marine Group, and volunteer response coordinated through the KZN Waste Network. 
“This week, 309 bags of nurdles were collected from 36 different locations in KZN including Amatikulu, Dokodweni, uMhlanga, North Beach and Umkomaas.”
Kramer said that, to date, 751.5 bags had been collected by all parties from 57 different locations in the province.
“Teams will continue to work along the KZN coastline actively collecting nurdles.”
