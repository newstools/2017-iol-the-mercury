A photo of an Australian police officer encountering a massive python got a huge reaction after being shared on social media.The officer and his partner were on a night patrol in northern Queensland when they came across the "monster" scrub python - or methystine python - on a road, police said.Spotting an opportunity, the officers quite calmly snapped a picture with the reptile."Fair to say that the snake was over five metres [long] but not really the type of reptile that you want to take a tape measure to," police told the BBC.Queensland police shared the photo, which was taken earlier this year, on social media and said it had received more than two million views and 10 000 comments.It had been shared 13 000 times. ABC Far North reported that David Walton from Cairns Snake Removals said the officers made the right decision not to handle the five to six-metre snake themselves."Certainly if you were to attempt to pick it up or grab it or poke it with a stick they can swing around quite quickly and if he grabs hold of you, you're in all sorts of trouble."Walton said the snake was a rare sight, and it was likely to be at the end of its life span.It was rare for a snake to live to that size. "We don't do boring," the Queensland Police  social media post read."You never really know what you are going to come across in a single shift." - BBC
