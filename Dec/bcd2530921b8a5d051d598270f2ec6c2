A diver who was meant to relieve another diver conducting maintenance on a ship berthed in Durban harbour was missing on Sunday night.

NSRI Durban station commander Clifford Ireland said their duty crew were activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following a request for assistance from Aquatech, which had reported a diver missing in the Port of Durban.

“We believe that the diver reportedly went into the water on a dive to relieve another diver who was already under a ship during dive maintenance operations under a ship berthed in Port.” 

He said at 5pm, after it appeared that the diver had not arrived to relieve the other diver as expected, Aquatech divers initiated a search and at 5.15 raised the alarm.

“The sea rescue craft Megan II was launched and our sea rescue vehicle was dispatched.”

Ireland said the SAPS, a police dive unit from Police Borderline and ER24 ambulance services were also activated.

A police dive unit searched under water - joined by Aquatech divers - while the NSRI sea rescue craft searched the surface.

“No sign of the missing diver, aged 23, has been found and police divers will continue an ongoing search operation,” said Ireland.
