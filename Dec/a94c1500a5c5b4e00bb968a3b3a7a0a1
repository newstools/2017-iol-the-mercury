The eThekwini municipality celebrated its first Metro Police Day, to honor and promote their services and reveal the city’s festive season management plans.
Speaking at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Tuesday, Mayor Zandile Gumede said that she wanted to assure the city’s residents that the police would ensure that law and order would be upheld during this season.




She said that Metro Police had various roles to fulfill in the city, namely: traffic policing; the policing of municipal by-laws and regulations which have the responsibility of the municipality; and the prevention of crime.
“Law enforcement officers will be out in full force. Metro Police officers, SAPS officers, security personnel and beach law enforcement officers will conduct regular patrols around the city, mainly at the beaches. 
We also have our disaster team ready to respond to any situation. We will be working closely with our province and other government service in responding to situations.”





“I want to assure eThekwini residents and tourists that will be visiting our shores during the festive season. Police presence and visibility will be high both in the city and in residential areas.”





Various mock displays – including those by the Metro Dog and Horse Units – were put on for the crowds.
