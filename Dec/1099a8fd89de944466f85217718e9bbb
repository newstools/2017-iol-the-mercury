Water outages continue to plague those residing on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast.
The Ugu municipality said via their Facebook page that those living in Umtentweni, Sea Park, Southport, Melville and Pumula that they were experiencing “major challenges” with the northern system which remained under severe strain thus causing sporadic supply and no water at all in some parts of the mentioned areas.
The Mercury has previously reported that the area has been troubled by numerous water interruptions over the past few months.
“We are fully aware of the communities’ frustration in the regard and we would like to assure you that plans to resuscitate supply in these areas are in progress also with the assistance of contractors and we hope to have water restored as soon as possible.”
They pleaded with the community not to despair as they were doing everything “humanly possible to ensure water services went back to normal” soon.
