When two cows arrived at an Avoca factory in 2012 frantic efforts were made to find the owners of the wandering heifers, but after a fruitless search, the duo promptly took up residence and became part of the family.
And, after her friend and fellow factory mascot Bonny went missing, Daisy’s adopted Corobrik family began looking for a new home for her.
“It was quite a sight, these two animals on the property and it became quite an attraction for visitors. They were always a particular highlight for the children at (our) annual Christmas party,” said Musa Shangase of Corobrik in a statement.
The bovine pair had free reign of the area, sauntering off the property from time-to-time without any hassle from entrance security. 
They would graze on the property, drink from the stream or water-filled troughs supplied by staff, and generally live a relaxed existence.
“However, when Bonny went missing a few months back, it was decided that the best option for Daisy would be a re-homing at a nearby farm. A number of generous animal-lovers willingly came to (our) assistance and she has settled in well at her new home on Camperdown Farm, a rescue home for animals.”
The cow, they said, was in the company of a herd of four-legged friends.
