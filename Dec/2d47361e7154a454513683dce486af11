Good news for Santa… security for reindeers just got a whole lot better after Finnish firms designed an app and sensors to help track reindeers which are in peril from predators.The plan is for reindeer who’ve been targeted by wolverines, wolves and lynx to be monitored across the forests where they roam, the BBC reported.Sensors around the necks of the female reindeer are linked to the herders' smartphones, allowing them to rescue hurt animals more quickly and identify the cause of death for those killed.The worst predator for reindeer are lynx and there is a plan to attempt to track them next year.Matti Sarkela, head of the Finnish Reindeer Herders' Association, said: "We have high expectations of the internet of things," adding that the main challenge is "that today's sensors are still quite large"."We need a sensor that lasts for a year, at a low cost, and with improved location technology - it can be hard to get good GPS signals in the high Arctic."The current sensors have been provided by Actility, while Finnish communications firm Digita began rolling out a special long-range network dubbed LoRaWAN last year to provide coverage to remote forests.Gizmodo reported that about 10 percent of reindeer are killed each year either by predators or traffic accidents. Reindeer herding is big business in Lapland with up to 300 000 animals managed a year, generating about $25m (R420m).In Northern Lapland, reindeer husbandry is still a major source of income for many. Twice a year, all reindeer are rounded up for earmarking and counting heads.Previously the herders' association launched an app to alert motorists when reindeer where near roads, and issue warnings to other drivers.
