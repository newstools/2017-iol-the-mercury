Johannesburg - Controversial Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma supporter Carl Niehaus has condemned his fellow comrades for “running to the court” after rulings on Friday excluded members of the party’s provincial executive from KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and North West’s Bojanala region from participating in the ANC’s elective conference.

Speaking on the sidelines of the conference which was supposed to start at 2pm, MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus said party members had a responsibility to deal with things politically.

“We believe quite strongly that ANC members have a responsibility to deal with politics, politically and not run to court.

“I think our ANC constitution should be amended to suspend ANC members who run to court, rather than exhausting the internal political structures of the ANC on matters where they are on disagreement,” said Niehaus. 

Speaking at a briefing last week, outgoing ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe referred to litigants who challenged the ANC as “bitter”, saying they did so because decisions didn’t go in their favour.

“I agree with him, and I agree with his sentiment as expressed that  members should not run to court but rather deal with matters internally in the political structures of the ANC. But unfortunately, one has to start asking yourself are these people who really carry the interests of the ANC at heart because a  process that continues along this route has got serious dangers for the African National Congress,” said Niehaus. 

He said a political organisation could not be ruled by court judgments. 

“I am not convinced that the members of the ANC who have run to court have actually utilised all the opportunities and avenues that were available to them to be able to address these issues,” said Niehaus.
