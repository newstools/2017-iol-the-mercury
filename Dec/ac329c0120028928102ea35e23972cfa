Illegal medications

If you are travelling abroad, it is wise to check the rules before trying to take medication into that country. 
For example, codeine is classed as an illegal drug in Greece, and individuals possessing it could conceivably be arrested, even if they were legitimately prescribed it in another country. Any medicines deemed to contain narcotics could have severe penalties in certain countries such as Indonesia if not declared at customs and the traveller must have a covering letter or prescription from their doctor.

Vaccinations

Before travelling, always check with your pharmacist whether any vaccinations are recommended for your destination.

Travel insurance

Make sure you have travel insurance if travelling abroad or to far-flung places which will ensure you get the best treatment if you become ill or have an accident which requires treatment at a hospital or medical centre.

Emergency numbers

Do some research about your destination and compile a list of emergency medical numbers such as local doctors, hospitals, poison help line numbers, ambulance services, a paediatrician, and others.

Locally and abroad, pharmacists are always on hand to help. In nearly every South African town you visit you will find a local pharmacy with a pharmacist who is able to advise and assist you should you find yourself in need of medical advice, repeat prescriptions, and over the counter medications.
