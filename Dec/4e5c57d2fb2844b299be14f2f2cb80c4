The Msunduzi municipality is working on plans to increase its burial sites in order to avert a cemetery crisis.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Recently, the council revealed that it had been working on a land swap deal with a private estate in Pietermaritzburg.
The name of the estate cannot be revealed because the negotiations are ongoing and the council has not made any recommendations.  
In the council agenda, the council had stated that the issue of cemetery was important and had therefore gave permission to the city managers to entertain unsolicited proposals to avert the crisis.

In the past, there were reports that the council needed more burial land. It was involved in a bitter dispute with residents from Sobantu township who wanted to build homes on land the municipality had earmarked for a cemetery.  
The city said the land would be ideal for the proposed cemetery as it could cater for close to 500 000 residents in Imbali and other surrounding townships. 
The agenda painted a grim picture of its cemeteries such as Mountain rise which it said had a six-month life span. Azalea cemetery would survive for eight months, they said.
Snathing has been closed, and Hollingwood was currently under construction with an expected lifespan of five years.
Msunduzi Municipal Manager Sizwe Hadebe declined to speak on the issue saying it was "unethical".
