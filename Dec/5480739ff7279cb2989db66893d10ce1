The Msunduzi Municipality has urged residents to be cautious on Tuesday as a severe weather warning has been issued by the South African Weather Services.

"SAWS has this morning issued a warning of extreme weather conditions throughout the province. The Msunduzi Municipality wishes to reiterate these warning,” said spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha.

She said the warning included for severe thunderstorms, with possible large hail. Damaging winds and flooding have been predicted.

Localised urban flooding is possible in parts of Pietermaritzburg today: “The public is urged to limit their travelling to what is necessary.”

“Take precautions when travelling and be sure their vehicles and animals have appropriate shelter. Persons residing in low-lying areas are to be extra cautious due to the  localised flooding, with special attention being focused on places like Jika Joe, Sobantu, Kwa Pata, Esigodini, and any other residential area bordering a stream or river,” said Mafumbatha.

She said low level bridges were of special concern with focus on bridges over the Msunduzi River based at Esigodini, Georgetown, Sobantu and Lincoln Meade. Motorists and pedestrians are urged to use alternate routes around these points.

“Due to the deluge expected, storm water drainage systems may be compromised and electrical supply systems and water supply may also be compromised and residents are advised to prepare themselves for any outages and or water supply shortages.”
 
On Twitter, the SAWS said, “”Showers and thundershowers observed over the eastern parts of the country, except over the extreme north-east generally, moving in an easterly direction. Please take care and be safe, especially when travelling.”
