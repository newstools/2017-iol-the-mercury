Thirty nine people have been rescued in two separate incidents deep within the Tugela Gorge following heavy rains in that area.
Mountain Club of South Africa Search and Rescue said via their Facebook page that late on December 6, a call for assistance had been received from a Royal Natal National Park ranger. 
“Two situations had occurred deep in the Tugela Gorge. A teenage boy had suffered a head injury and clavicle (collarbone) fracture. In addition, 36 teenage females and two teachers were trapped on an island in the swollen Tugela River, where heavy rain had been falling for many hours.”
They said a club rescue team had been dispatched by road at last light for the park.

“(The team) then met up with members of Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and Okhahlamba disaster management.”
They said that the long night’s rescue then started. 
“First was to treat and then carry the injured boy out who was then taken by road to hospital.”

The team, they said, had been unable to cross the swollen river and bivvied for the night near to the trapped party. 
“Early in the morning with a lower water level, ropes were set up and the party was brought to safety.”
