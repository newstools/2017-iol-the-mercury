Faith leaders led the march from the Diakonia premises into the city central centre with the goal of creating awareness and to hand over a memorandum to eThekwini Municipality, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and South African Police Services (SAPS), calling for them to clamp down on the severe abuses.

The body's executive director Nomabelu Mvambo-Dandala said: “As an organisation that is about social justice, gender justice is an integral part of that and, over the years, we adopted the 'Thursdays in Black' campaign and we took it upon ourselves to raise and create awareness around it. As much as we have 16 days of activism (for no violence against women and children), there is a need for a mechanism which helps us as society to be mindful of the scourge of gender-based violence.”

The council’s "Thursdays in Black" (TIB) campaign was started 2008, and has since been successful in creating awareness of gender-based violence matters. The idea behind the campaign is that members of society wear black on Thursdays to raise awareness about the extent of violence on women and children.

Dressed in black, the marchers filled Medwood Gardens, a park opposite Durban City Hall, in song. 

Asha Moodley of Agenda Feminist Media addressed the crowds, and explained that there were many types of violence that women were exposed to, ranging from the physical and emotional to the psychological.

“From when girl children are born, they are tutored to be silent, including being silent about abuse and other forms of violence perpetrated against them. Insubordination of women is intrinsically violence against them,” she said.
