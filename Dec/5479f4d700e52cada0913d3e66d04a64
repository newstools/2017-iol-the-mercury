Police are looking for several suspects linked to two recent KwaZulu-Natal hijacking incidents. 
KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said in a statement that on Sunday at about 7.30am, a victim was driving his white Mercedes Benz from Hlabisa when he was ordered to pull over by unknown six men at a speed hump at R618 road near Nkwalini at Somkhele reserve, Kwamsane.
