“The roofs of a school and several houses were blown away. 






So far, we counted 16 homes that were severely damaged. There are also homes which were flooded and many have broken windows where the hailstones hit,” said Nkosi.

“So far we have supplied clothes, 109 blankets, 18 tents, 211 (foam) mattresses and tarpaulin sheets to temporarily keep their homes dry,” he said.
