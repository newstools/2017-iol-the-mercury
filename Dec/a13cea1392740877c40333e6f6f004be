The book – which includes mouth-watering South African indigenous recipes from amadumbe salad served with homemade pesto, imifino served with phuthu, umleqwa, samp risotto, and chamolia (African kale) in peanut sauce – was launched last week.
Mqwebu uncovers stories of how certain African dishes came to existence, with each recipe revealing their cultural significance through writing on their historical anecdotes.

“Each recipe is accompanied by stunning images styled by acclaimed food stylist Niki Hattingh and photographed by Nicole Louw, and captures the essence of food that nostalgically titillates the senses.”
The accomplished chef spent ten years training and mastering her cooking skills in South Africa and around the world, including at schools and kitchens in New York, London, Paris, Bremen and Shannary. 
“Having trained at the prestigious Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland, she has learnt how to make yoghurt, butter, and preserves, and all recipes and methodology included in the book.”
Lindi Ndebele-Koka, senior manager of Cultural and Creative Industries Development at the department of Arts and Culture, writes of the book: “Nompumelelo’s recipes pay passionate homage not only to her heritage and origins... (but) also paints a diverse colourful picture of who South Africa is.”
