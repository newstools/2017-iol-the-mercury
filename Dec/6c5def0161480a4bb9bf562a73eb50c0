With just over two weeks left in the year, KwaZulu-Natal has surpassed the number of rhinos poached – as compared to this time last year in the province – bringing the number of animals lost to 218.
And, said Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo, this number reflected 37 more animals as compared to this time in 2016.
“But this number, without the interventions we have put in place to prevent poaching, would be much higher. Our actions have yielded positive results.”
Mntambo said that they had managed to prevent attacks in parks by apprehending suspected poachers – armed with high-calibre weapons – who had managed to gain entry into parks before they had managed to kill any animals.
He said that some of the action they had taken to curb poaching included the improvement of co-operation between different law enforcement agencies.
“This has made our job far easier and our operations more efficient.”

He said that communities living in the parks or just outside them had played a pivotal role in – among other things – in the arrest of poachers.
“They are our eyes and ears on the ground. They understand that what they do is important and it makes them feel responsible for the park and its animals.”
Without being able to go into much detail, Mntambo said that the body had been using a “more targeted approach” when it came to rhino poaching.

“We are placing an emphasis on monitoring rhino reserves.”
The body has made 150 arrests of suspected poachers this year.
“Most of these suspects come from Mpumalanga.”
