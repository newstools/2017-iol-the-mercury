A Durban attorney, on holiday in Australia, has described the busy, chaotic scene as police and emergency services responded after a vehicle crashed into a group of pedestrians in Melbourne on Thursday afternoon.

Attorney David Warmback, who is on holiday with his wife, said they had been returning to their hotel after a visit to the MCG and Rod Laver arena when they saw that the area near to the hotel, about 30 metres from the incident on Flinders Street, had been cordoned off.

"The area was cordoned off and under lockdown. There is a large police presence with many ambulances and the scene remains under police control. Two helicopters are hovering and reports indicate that 13 have been taken to hospital with at least one child seriously injured."

AP reported that two men were arrested after the car in which they were travelling crashed into pedestrians.

Victorian state police said in a statement the driver of the vehicle and a second man were in police custody after the incident, which occurred on Flinders Street in the city’s central business district just after 4:30 p.m. when the area was busy with Christmas shoppers.

The motive of the incident was not clear immediately. 

Sky News Australia reported the driver of the white Suzuki SUV was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed after his vehicle crashed into a bollard by a cable car stop.

Media reports said 13 people have been taken to hospitals, including a pre-school aged child in serious condition with head injuries.

Witnesses told Sky News the car ran a red light, sped up and struck pedestrians, in an area with a 40-kilometer (25-mile) -per-hour speed limit.

“As it (the car) approached this intersection … it just mowed everybody down, people were flying everywhere,” one witness who identified herself only as Sue told radio station 3AW.

Police said in a statement they had “saturated the … area in the vicinity of Flinders, Elizabeth and Swanston streets to ensure community safety.”
