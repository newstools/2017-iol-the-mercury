Harare ‑ Zimbabwe's former finance and economic development minister Ignatius Chombo, his alleged accomplices Kudzanai Chipanga and Innocent Hamandishe, were arrested on Friday, on charges of criminal nuisance.

The three were arrested Friday morning and appeared in court before magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa. The prosecution did not oppose bail.

They were remanded to January 8, on bail conditions attached to their first case - where they face a raft of charges.

Chombo was Zanu PF secretary for administration during Robert Mugabe’s time as party and country president, while Chipanga was youth league secretary and Hamandishe was youth league political commissar before they were kicked out of the party in November.

Allegations against the three are that between December 8 and 13, they connived with a Mathew Mleya, who is at large, and took photographs of themselves sporting Zanu PF regalia “knowing that they are expelled” from the ruling party.

The prosecution said they wore caps that bore the Zanu PF flag and were inscribed “ED and Kutonga Kwaro”.

ED is short for President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa’s name, while Kutonga Kwaro is a song by weel-known contemporary musician Jah Prayzah.

The court heard the three then posted images on social media while clad in the ruling party’s regalia, which the Zanu PF hierarchy “adjudged as likely to create a nuisance to Zanu PF political party”.
