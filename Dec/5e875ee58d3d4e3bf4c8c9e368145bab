"Upon arrival officers found the mother in her room. She was in excruciating pain and ready to deliver the child. Sithole prepared the mother for the delivery and within minutes he managed to assist with the birth of a healthy baby girl. He cut the umbilical cord and cleaned the child before handing her back to her mother."
Both mother and child were transported to Montebello Hospital by the provincial ambulance services.
