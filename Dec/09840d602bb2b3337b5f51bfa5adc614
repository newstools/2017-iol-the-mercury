DURBAN - TWO winners, the 2012 winner of the Idols singing competition, Khaya Mthethwa and last year's Miss South Africa, Ntandoyenkosi Kunene, are one step closer to tying the knot. Mthethwa, his close friends and family made the 650km trip to Mpumalanga province on Saturday where they presented the Kunene family with gifts as part of their uMembeso, a traditional gift exchange ceremony. The Mthethwa family presented the Kunene's with blankets, pots and other gifts. The Mthethwa and Kunene families would have been in a boisterous 'sing-off' during the festivities, with each family trying to out-sing the other. The couple were in high spirits and wore matching Nguni prints. 'Mr and Mrs Important', as Mthethwa, a pastor at uMlazi's popular Oasis Church - has dubbed their union, was seen with a bounce in his step on Saturday.WATCH

There was ululation as they walked side-by-side into a marquee in the Kunene residence. Mthethwa was seen dancing in excitement as women from his family sang that Kunene will 'wash for us and cook for us'. Mthethwa became the first black Idols when he won the competition in 2012. His bae, who is popularly known as 'Ntando', handed over her Miss South Africa crown earlier this year to Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, who was last week crowned Miss Universe.
