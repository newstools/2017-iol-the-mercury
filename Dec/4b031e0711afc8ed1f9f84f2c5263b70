Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will be inaugurated as chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal next week, said the institution in a statement.
Justice Mogoeng was appointed by UKZN Council as chancellor on August 7, 2017 and will serve in the position for a period of four years. 
He will be the third chancellor to hold office at UKZN and he succeeds Dr Zweli Mkhize who served as the University’s chancellor for two terms. 
Dr Frene Ginwala was inaugurated as the first Chancellor of the University in 2005. 
Announcing the Inauguration, chairperson of UKZN Council, Reverend Dr Vukile Mehana said: “We welcome Justice Mogoeng to the University and we are looking forward to working with him for the next four years. We are confident that the wealth of knowledge and experience that he brings with him will be instrumental in fulfilling his duties in this critical role.”

“He is no doubt one of the best legal minds ever produced by this country and we are proud to welcome him to the UKZN family,” said UKZN’s vice-chancellor and principal, Dr Albert van Jaarsveld, echoing Mehana’s sentiments.
The university said in a statement: “In all the positions he has held, including his current one as the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, Mogoeng has displayed dedication, diligence, integrity and honesty, which are characteristics that are in line with the University’s REACHT values. REACHT stands for Respect, Excellence, Accountability, Client Orientation, Honesty and Trust.”
Justice Mogoeng boasts 31 years of service in the legal fraternity having cut his teeth as a Supreme Court prosecutor in Mafikeng in 1986. Hard work and dedication to the profession ensured that Mogoeng rose through the ranks, culminating in him being appointed the Chief Justice in 2011.
