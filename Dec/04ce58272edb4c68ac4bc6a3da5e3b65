A crisis was quickly averted when a boat crew – whose vessel had capsized when launching – reacted speedily, preventing any injuries.
Spokesperson for Agulhas House and an National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Alfred coxswain Keryn van der Walt and the institute said in a joint statement that the incident had taken place at 7.13am on Friday.
“The Agulhas House charter craft Agulhas 3 capsized while launching from Umkomaas for a scuba diving trip to Aliwal Shoal with eight French nationals onboard and two crew (members), a dive master and a skipper.”
They commended the dive master and skipper for getting everyone to swim together towards the beach where bystanders from local dive centres assisted all to get out of the water.

The charter company, they said in the statement, were grateful for all of the support and everyone who came together to assist in making sure that everyone was safely out of the water.
