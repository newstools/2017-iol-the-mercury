Durban - A Durban mother has admitted to lying about her infant daughter’s “kidnapping” earlier this year.

The woman pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, defeating the administration of justice and making a false statement, in the Durban Regional Court, on Wednesday morning. She is not being named to protect the identity of the minor child.

Reports that a month-old baby girl had been abducted from the Durban city centre, triggered a large scale search earlier this year by police, security firms and residents who banded together to look for the girl.

The case also trended on social media as dozens prayed for the child's safe return following public appeals made by the woman and the woman's s husband.

Then two days later, police pulled a vehicle over at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza and found the baby, with a man who claimed at the time that he was her biological father.

Her mother allegedly gave her to her lover voluntarily.

They were both arrested and baby was taken to a place of safety.

The woman is expected to be sentenced next year.

Her co-accused’s case will continue next month.
