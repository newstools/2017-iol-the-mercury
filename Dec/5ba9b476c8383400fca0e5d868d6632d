After ten days in hospital, a Durban electrician – who was injured in a severe electric shock incident last month – has been discharged.
Lungani Mbatha, 26, said Netcare 911 in a statement on Monday, had been working on a construction site near Durban on November 18 when disaster struck. 
“I have never had a serious electrical shock before, and I can’t remember much of what happened. All I know is that we were busy connecting wires, I shouted out and I don’t remember anything after that until I woke up in Netcare uMhlanga Hospital,” he said.
According to Netcare 911 advanced life support paramedic, Shaun Paul in the statement, Mbatha owed his life to the streamlined emergency medical care he received, starting with a “good Samaritan” who recognised that Mbatha was not breathing and did not have a pulse after he collapsed from the shock.
“Then (he) immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as well as the early activation of emergency medical services (EMS) to attend to Mbatha.”
Physician Dr Nitin Ghila at the hospital said that the electrical shock had caused ventricular fibrillation, a severe disruption of the heart muscles’ natural electrical impulses that control the heartbeat. 
This resulted in cardiac arrest, as his heart was unable to pump vital oxygenated blood through the body.  
Paul, as well as intermediate life support paramedics, Isaac Pillay and Collin Krishnalall, arrived on the scene three minutes after receiving the call, and using a manual defibrillator, administered one electric shock and then continued performing chest compressions and ventilations. 
Mbatha was discharged on November 28.
