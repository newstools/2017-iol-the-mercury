Johannesburg - Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini says issues faced by ANC provinces where court disputes have been lodged need to be prioritised by the new leadership.He said the ANC should work harder on attending to issues faced by its structures to ensure that unity is at the centre of the organisation.  He was speaking at the sidelines of the ANC elective conference on Tuesday, following the election of the party’s new top six on Monday.In the run-up to the conference a number of the party’s provincial structures found themselves in court having to answer questions on the legitimacy of the provincial conferences and branch general meetings.The provincial executive committees (PEC) in the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal were found to be unlawful by the courts due to proper processes not being followed. The structures couldn’t vote at the conference.

If we look at the KwaZulu-Natal situation, for KZN no will have claimed to have won, but the ANC. So if all the structures are focused on fixing the movement and working towards one direction and ensure that the way forward is unity,” he said.On Tuesday morning, rumours were circulating at the conference over a possible recount of the votes for the position of secretary general – which was won by Free State Premier Ace Magashule.He was contesting the position with former KZN Premier Senzo Mchunu. The margin of votes between the two was 24, Magashule received 2360 and Mchunu 2336.There are questions over the 68 “missing” votes that could have tilted the election in Mchunu’s favour. By mid-morning it was still unclear whether there would be a recount. Political Bureau
