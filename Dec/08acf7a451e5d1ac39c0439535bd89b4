Eleven people have been left injured after a taxi and light motor vehicle collided head-on just outside Pietermaritzburg on Sunday afternoon.
ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring paramedics said in a statement that paramedics had been called to the scene at 4.45pm and immediately responded.
The incident, he said, had taken place on the Edendale Road. Earlier on Sunday, in a separate incident around the same area, a biker was killed in a crash involving another bike, a truck and a light motor vehicle.

"Upon arrival, paramedics found the vehicles in the middle of the road. The passengers from the taxi were found walking around on the scene."
