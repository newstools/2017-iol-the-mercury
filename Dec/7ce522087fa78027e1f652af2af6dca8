Sydenham Police arrested two suspects aged 27 and 24 for the possession of unlicensed firearms. The suspects were wanted for a house robbery they allegedly committed in the area last week. The two were arrested recently when members of the Sydenham Crime Prevention, K9 Unit and Trio Task Team  spotted a vehicle they thought looked suspicious while conducting  their Festive Season Operations, in the Reservoir Hills area. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the members stopped the vehicle and the suspects sped off, resulting in a car chase. The suspects were cornered in the KwaNdengezi area and caught in the possession of guns. “Both suspects were charged for possession of unlicensed firearms. The two appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court with one being remanded in custody and the other released on a warning.” In another operation conducted on Tuesday, December 12, eThekwini Central members arrested 75 suspects between the ages of 20 and 47. They were charged with various crimes like the possession of dagga, heroin, theft from a motor vehicle, the possession of housebreaking instruments and others.  All of the arrested suspects were scheduled to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court.
