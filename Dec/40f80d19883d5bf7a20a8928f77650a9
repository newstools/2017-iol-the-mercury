In a bid to streamline its operations, SAA has teamed up and “shared” flights with its low-cost subsidiary Mango.The airline said in a statement on Thursday last week that the partnership would see additional Mango-operated flights for the domestic market.The number of flights offered by SAA and Mango between Johannesburg and Durban and Johannesburg and Cape Town has not changed, but the number of flights per airline has been adjusted.Currently, both together offer 200 return flights per week between Johannesburg and Durban and 278 return flights per week between Johannesburg and Cape Town.They said that once fully implemented, Mango would operate 132 return flights on the Johannesburg -Durban route and 116 return flights on the Johannesburg-Cape Town route per week. “SAA will operate 68 return flights between Johannesburg and Durban, and 162 return flights between Johannesburg and Cape Town.”Frequent traveller Clive Jones from Durban told The Mercury that he was worried about what the adjustments would mean for people coming in on early morning flights, who now would have to wait longer periods for their connections.“My daughter, now residing in the UK, booked a holiday some months ago with a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Durban within two hours of landing from London.”His daughter is set to fly to SA in April next year.But now, he said, her flight has been changed.“My daughter and her companion are now facing the prospect of waiting from arrival in Johannesburg at 9am to 5pm for their flight to Durban.”Jones said he had always flown SAA, and preferred the airline over any others.The airline said in the statement: “To enhance efficiency ... whilst responding to demand, the two airline brands will ensure seamless implementation of the revised schedule with effect from January 15, 2018.”The airline’s chief executive Vuyani Jarana, said that they had reviewed their offerings. The changes were reflected in all the SAA and Mango distribution systems from December 12, 2017.Re-booking conditions applicable- Re-book on to another SAA flight for a later date at no extra charge and subject to availability of the same booking class.- Change of cabin will not be permitted- This policy is applicable to South African Airways flights only, issued on SA (083) ticket stock on or before December 12 and not on separate tickets of other airlines- Tickets must be re-issued on or before December 31, 2017- Mango flights will operate on Boeing 737-800s and SAA will discontinue operating Airbus A340-600s on the Johannesburg-Cape Town route.- Members of Voyager, SAA’s frequent flyer programme, will continue to earn Miles on Mango operated flights if booked on the SAA code and will continue to enjoy the SAA baggage allowance, lounge access and a seamless transfer on to the regional and international network services of SAA.
