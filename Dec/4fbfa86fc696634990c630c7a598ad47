Four suspects who appeared in court for the murder of a police officer have abandoned their bail application.
The suspects appeared in the Eshowe Magistrate’s Court on Monday for the murder of Constable Jabulani Mavundla. Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Mavundla, who was stationed at Mbongolwane police station, was on duty with a colleague when they attended to a complaint of robbery at Maqhogo area. 
On their way back to the station, they were ambushed by criminals who opened fire at them. 
"Constable Mavundla was shot and the vehicle lost control, hitting the trees nearby. He died at the scene,” said Zwane.
