Five days after a dog in KZN was chained to a fence and shot with a high calibre rifle, an inspector from the local SPCA found the animal still alive.Spokesperson for the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), Grace de Lange said this week that their offices only learnt of the November 25 incident after the video footage emerged on social media at the weekend.The graphic clip was widely circulated and in it, a man can be seen opening fire on a dog chained to a fence.Another man - who was said to be the deputy mayor of Mthonjaneni, on the KZN North Coast, Philani Ntombela - can be seen in the background, coaxing the shooter on.According to Times Live, Ntombela last Friday confirmed that it had been him and his bodyguard in the clip and said the dog had been “terrorising” the locals and attacking their livestock.This week, however, he denied having said this and refused to comment.“The Eshowe SPCA inspector attended to the complaint as soon as he was made aware of the situation and found the dog still alive, with multiple gunshot wounds,” De Lange said this week. De Lange said the dog was taken to the local vet where it was humanely put down.De Lange described the dog’s shooting as “unnecessary and cruel” and said while a case had not yet been opened, the NSPCA would be prosecuting on behalf of the Eshowe SPCA.Charges to be laid against deputy mayor over dog shootingMeanwhile the Mthonjaneni municipality’s spokesperson, Thami Shangase, said yesterday that an inquiry into Ntombela was not going ahead.Shangase said should a criminal case be opened at a later stage, they would reconsider the matter.
