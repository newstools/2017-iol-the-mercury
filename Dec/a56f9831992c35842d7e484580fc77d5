They department said in a statement: "As the festive season begins, (we) will be conducting a Coastal Awareness Campaign in order to highlight some of the issues that impact the coastal environment, especially during this time of the year."
These issues, they said, included, but were not limited to: access to Coastal Public Property (CPP); vehicle access on the Coastal Zone; marine pollution; and the compliance with and enforcement of legislation relevant to the coastal environment.
"South Africa has a coastline just under 3000 km with numerous beaches designated for public's enjoyment and recreation and government, in its capacity as the public trustee of all coastal public property, has a duty to manage, protect and enhance the interests of the whole community, so as to ensure that the natural resources within the coastal areas are used in an economically-justifiable and ecologically-sustainable manner for the benefit of current and future generations."
