More than 1 100 bags filled with litter were prevented from entering the sea off the KwaZulu-Natal coast this past month thanks to various beach-clean ups.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The initiatives – organised by the Plastics SA Sustainability Division – came together, said the organisation’s sustainability director Douw Steyn, after “a staggering amount of litter” made its way down the Umgeni River after heavy rains.
“We were monitoring the situation closely and realised that drastic action needed to be taken to ensure that this litter does not end up in the oceans.”
He said that, thanks to the great team work and support of their product recovery organisations (Polystyrene Association of SA, SAVA, PETCO and Polyco), the Dusi Umgeni Conservation Trust (DUCT), the KZN Marine Waste Network and local volunteer organisations such as the Clean-Up Blue Lagoon team, they were able to contract clean-up teams and mobilise more than 120 volunteers.

“Over a period of five days, (we) collected more than 1 100 bags filled with litter,” Steyn said.  
During the same week, the body also supported various other clean-ups in the area (organised by, amongst others, the Durban Green Corridor, Aqua Addicts and the Clean Surf Project) by donating more than 7 000 bags for their campaigns. 
 “Whether at the Blue Lagoon, uMlazi river mouth, Cuttings Beach or Isipingo, these clean-ups all reflected the negative impact that areas with little or no waste management have on our environment, and man’s total disregard for nature. The majority of the waste that we collected was post-consumer packaging materials that have a value for recyclers and are in high demand for recycling into a myriad of other products. This material should not end up in landfill, and most definitely not in our oceans.” Steyn said.
