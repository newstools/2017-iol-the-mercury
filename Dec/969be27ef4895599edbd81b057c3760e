A 46-year-old man – believed to be a security guard – has been arrested following a Christmas Day shooting, which left a Mandeni father dead.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane on Tuesday confirmed that a case of murder had been opened at Mandeni police station after a 52-year-old man was “accidentally” shot.
“It is alleged that a security guard was attacked by dogs at about 2.30pm and he allegedly fired a warning shot. It is reported that the bullet ricocheted and hit the man in the head,” he said.
