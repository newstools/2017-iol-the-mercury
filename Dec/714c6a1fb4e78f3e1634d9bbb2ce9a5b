The quick reaction of a bystander at a South Coast beach on Tuesday led to the rescue of a young child.
Netcare 911 KZN spokesperson Shawn Herbst said in a statement on Wednesday that at approximately 5.30pm, they had responded to calls of a drowning incident at a popular swimming beach near Port Edward.
"Although details surrounding the incident are not confirmed, reports from the scene allege that a four-year-old boy was found unconscious floating in the sea by his aunt in the bathing area."

Herbst said that it had been reported that the child had been removed from the water by the aunt and was in an "unresponsive state".
"Chest compressions were performed by a member of the public resulting in the child coughing up water and regaining consciousness shortly afterwards. Netcare 911 paramedics arrived on the scene and were escorted to a first aid room of a nearby water park where the child was found to be in a stable condition."

He said that it was unknown how long the child had been in the water but he had been assessed on the scene and transported to hospital for further assessment and care.
Herbst advised extra vigilance during the holiday period and for guardians to keep a watchful eye on children and potential water hazards.
"Learning first aid and CPR may help you save a life."
