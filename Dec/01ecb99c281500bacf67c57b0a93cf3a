Five men have been left injured, one seriously, in a collision involving a heavy duty vehicle on Blackburn Road in Durban North on Monday.
Crisis Medical's Kyle van Reenen said in a statement that emergency services arrived to find that the vehicle had careened off the roadway, colliding with a concrete palisade fence.
"Four occupants of the vehicle sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate, whilst the driver, a male believed to be approximately 50 years of age, was found entrapped in the wreckage, having suffered life threatening injuries."

He said that paramedics from Crisis Medical, Rescue Care, Netcare911 and KZN EMS, worked fervently for over 30 minutes to stabilise the man, while emergency workers from the Ethekwini Fire and Rescue Services, cut the man free, using the 'Jaws of Life'.
"Once free, the man was placed onto a mechanical ventilator to assist him in breathing and taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where a team of trauma surgeons awaited his arrival."
