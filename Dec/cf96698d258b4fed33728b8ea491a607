Johannesburg - Day two of the African National Congress (ANC) 54th National Elective Conference is off to a busy start.

The conference is taking place at the Nasrec centre in Soweto and will see the new leadership of the party being elected in what is considered a highly contested race. 

Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union (AU) chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma are the frontrunners.

On Sunday, delegates began streaming into Nasrec, where credentials and possible nominations are expected to take place.

Busses were seen dropping off delegates, who peacefully made their way to the centre.

On Saturday, the contentious issue of the eligibility of some delegates to participate in the conference became the first hurdle on the first day.







Credentials of delegates have to be adopted by the conference in order for voting of new leaders to proceed.

Vendors meanwhile, were again spotted setting up stalls with paraphernalia outside the venue.

The conference was off to a slow start after proceedings were delayed for hours due to registration of delegates.

The formalities then kicked off in the afternoon with a final speech from outgoing ANC president Jacob Zuma.

Zuma used his speech to praise the ANCYL as well as the women's league while criticising the alliance partners, who called for him to step down.
