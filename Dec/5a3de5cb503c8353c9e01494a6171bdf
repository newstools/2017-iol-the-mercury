Current ANC treasurer general, Zwile Makize, declining the nomination for position of deputy president. Video by Zintle MahlatiIn the post of secretary general,  KZN ANC chairperson Senzo Mchunu and Ace Magashule were nominated and accepted.For deputy secretary general: Jessie Duarte and Zingiswa Losi are nominees.And for treasurer general: Paul Mashatile, Numvula Mokonyane and Maite Nkoana Mashabane.Mokonyane declined nomination for the position.Nominees for national chair are; Gwede Mantashe and Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa  who have both accepted.Day two of the conference, which takes place in Nasrec near Soweto, has been delayed by several hours as delegates spent time finalising the credentials of delegates in attendance. Once those were finalised the number of delegates eligible to vote stood at around 4700.The Provincial Executive Committees in the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal were barred from voting following court judgments that found them unlawful.Earlier in the day, deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said they hoped delegates would be able to start voting at night with the new leadership being announced in the morning. But this also seems unlikely as a number of items were still on the agenda that still needed to be tackled before voting.Political Bureau
