The fight continues."

She also questionShe however, expressed pride at the fact that history had been made with the inclusion of a female candidate in the election. The league was also question on whether they would support Ramaphosa as a leader, especially in light of remarks Dlamini reportedly made in the lead up to elections."We will support Ramaphosa, that is the culture in the ANC, to subject ourselves to the elected leader," she said. She added that they would not leave the party, adding that the ANC was their home.IOL
