Cape Town - The body of a 35-year-old mother shot and killed in the driveway of her home in Montevideo, Bishop Lavis, was discovered by her father, who                                                                                                                                        was responding to the screams of her distraught 16-year-old daughter on Monday.
This was according to relatives who spoke to the Cape Times following the murder of Angela Marinus. Her daughter was wounded in her left foot. 

Marinus was returning from visiting a friend and was parking her car in the yard when the killer opened her driver side door. 

Her aunt Pauline Grove said Marinus’s family went outside after hearing the shots and then screams.

“My father told us that as he came out, he heard someone running from the yard and then saw Angie’s daughter, who said to him, ‘my dad shot my mom’. My father opened the car door and found her covered in blood, but by then the suspect was long gone and Angie was gone,” Grove said.

She added that Marinus’s daughter was set to undergo surgery but was still in shock and had not spoken since the incident.

She said counselling had been offered to the family, and the teenager would be provided a psychologist after her surgery.

“Angie was such a loving and caring person but her forgiving nature had made her stay in a toxic relationship.

“We hope young women will learn through our tragedy because she never told her family of the abuse; we found out through friends afterwards,” said Grove.

Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a murder and an attempted murder case had been opened for 
investigation.

“Police were called to a shooting incident that occurred on Monday night at about 10.20pm at Nevada Street, Montevideo, Bishop Lavis.

“A 35- year-old woman was shot and killed and a 16-year-old girl injured, No arrests have been made,” he said.

Police urged anyone with information related to the incident to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
