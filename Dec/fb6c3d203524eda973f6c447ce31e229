A 34-year-old man was arrested on Monday by members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) after he allegedly raped his sister-in-law at knife point in Esnembe in KwaZulu-Natal.
"At approximately 4am, RUSA was contacted by the victim's employer reporting the incident. Officers were dispatched to the location and upon arrival were informed that at approximately 11pm (on Sunday) night the victim's brother-in-law came to her room which is situated in a compound on a farm," they said in a statement.
They said after she had opened the door he produced a knife and raped her. 
"During the rape, he assaulted and bit her face. After the suspect fell asleep, she managed to escape and fled to her employer's residence where she sought assistance."
The officers then went to the compound and found the suspect asleep in the victim's bed. 
"Officers placed him under arrest. The pocket knife belonging to the suspect was recovered from under the bed."
They said that while being interviewed, the suspect, who is a resident of Lesotho and is also employed at the farm as a cane cutter, confirmed that he had raped the woman. 
"He was handed over to police and is currently detained at the Umhlali Police Station."
