Durban - Having received information from the community about people who were in possession of unlicensed firearms, police pounced in KwaMakhutha, arresting two men.
SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the police had received a tip-off that several people in the area were in possession of unlicensed firearms and they raided their homes as part of festive season crime prevention operations.

“The members were following up on information. They spotted a house fitting the description given to them and it was searched,” she said. 

 “A 24-year-old man was arrested after he was found with two unlicensed pistols and ammunitions. The members proceeded to another homestead where they recovered another 9mm pistol with ammunition. A 39-year-old suspect was arrested and charged,” she said. 

Both recovered firearms would be sent for ballistic tests. The suspects are due to appear in the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court on Friday.

KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the arrest. 

“Community members must not shield criminals in their areas but they must expose them and report them to the police,” he said.
