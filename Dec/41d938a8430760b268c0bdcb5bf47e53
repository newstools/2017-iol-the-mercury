A food borne disease has killed 36 people in South Africa, with more than 520 more infected.This is according to an alert by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), posted on Tuesday.According to the NICD, of the 557 laboratory confirmed cases of  listeriosis - a serious bacterial disease - as of November 29, 345 cases were reported in Gauteng, 71 in the Western Cape and 37 in KZN.Most cases were among babies aged less than 28 days and those aged 15 to 49 years old.The disease is found in soil, water and contaminated food and is spread through eating contaminated food products such as raw or unpasteurised milk and soft cheeses, but also vegetables, processed foods, ready-to-eat meats and smoked fish products, said the NICD.In a statement about the outbreak, Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said private healthcare facilities accounted for 34% of cases, while 66% came from public health facilities. “Given that only 17% of South Africans use private health facilities, this proportion of cases from private health facilities is too high. This indicates that the source of the outbreak is likely to be a food product that is widely distributed and consumed by people across all socioeconomic groups,” said Motsoaledi.The course of the contamination is being investigated but authorities believe it is most likely farms and agriculture or food processing plants.The public is warned to wash their hands before and after handling food and ensure that food is cooked properly.
