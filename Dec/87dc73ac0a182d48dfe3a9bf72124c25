Durban - ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has dismissed the “sexting” scandal allegedly involving him and a 23-year-old woman student as just a deflection ahead of the ANC’s national conference which kicks off at the weekend.Mantashe was responding yesterday after WeeklyXpose, a news website, published salacious Whatsapp exchanges allegedly between Mantashe and a woman described as 23-year-old Unisa student.Mantashe’s number is clearly visible on the screenshots of the message exchanges published by the website. When approached for comment Mantashe said:  “I do not want to talk sex now, I want to discuss conference. It is a deflection.”He would not confirm if the messages were legitimate. “It is a deflection,” he retorted when asked. According to the website, owned by flamboyant businessman Kenny Kunene, the WhatsApp exchanges between Mantashe and the woman “started when she “erroneously sent Mantashe pictures from her modelling portfolio which she intended to send to a modelling agency.”The report further quotes the Whatsapp exchanges and one where Mantashe allegedly requested the woman to send him pictures of her vagina. Blurred pictures, allegedly sent to Mantashe by the woman, who is named in the article, were also published on the site yesterday.Mantashe is the latest high-ranking official of the ANC to be embroiled in an alleged scandal involving younger women.
