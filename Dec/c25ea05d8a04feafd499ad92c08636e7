The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said in a statement on Thursday that at 5.36pm on Wednesday, Richards Bay duty crew had been activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following reports of a drowning in the vicinity of a beach in front of RBM (Richards Bay Minerals).
"The sea rescue craft Spirit of Richards Bay was launched and an NSRI rescue vehicle and SAPS Search and Rescue responded."
They said that upon arrival on the scene, a search had been initiated for a local 13-year-old male reported by community members to be missing in the surf.

"It appears that the incident may have happened at around 3.30pm when a group of youngsters were playing with a ball on the beach and the missing teenager had gone into the surf to retrieve the ball but disappeared under water."
Despite an extensive search, they said, no sign of the teenager had been found.
"Police have opened an investigation and a Search and Rescue team are continuing with an ongoing search."
Earlier this week, the body of a teenager, who drowned while swimming at Sheffield, washed up at a nearby beach.
