A man was left seriously injured on Wednesday morning following a motorbike accident on a mountain just outside Pietermaritzburg.
ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said in a statement that paramedics had received a call from the scene in the Esselen area and immediately responded.
"A 4x4 medical response vehicle had to be used to ferry paramedics to the scene, as there were no accessible roads to the patient."

Upon arrival, he said, paramedics had found the man, 39, lying next to his off-road motorbike.
"Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained a serious injury to his leg."
Meiring said that the man had been treated for his injury and provided with pain-relief medication before he was airlifted by the AMS Medical Helicopter to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg for further treatment.
Earlier this month, a biker was killed in an accident near the Lynnfield turn off, just outside Pietermaritzburg.
