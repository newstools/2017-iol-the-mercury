Johannesburg - The ANC Women’s League has stopped short of saying that the party’s newly elected deputy president David Mabuza and secretary general Ace Magashule betrayed them.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Magashule and Mabuza were central in the campaign for former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to become the ruling party’s leader.
But this failed after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa won the race.
On Monday the leadership of the league blamed Dlamini’s Zuma’s failed bid on patriarchy and betrayal.
They however said they would rally behind Ramaphosa.
The commitment to support Ramaphosa came amid fears that the Women’s League was due to challenge the election outcomes.

During the announcement on Monday night, several women’s league members including its president Bathabile Dlamini and her national executive expressed disapproval of Ramaphosa’s election.
Dlamini was reduced to tears and refused to answer any question on their loss.
However, things calmed earlier this morning, when Dlamini and her executive pledged their support for Ramaphosa.
“I am a woman. Women are very loyal in their nature. We are not going to form another organisation. We will remain in the ANC. ANC is our home,” she said.
Dlamini and ANC Women’s League spokeswoman Thoko Xasa took a swipe Mabuza and Magashule seemingly having used Dlamini-Zuma’s campaign for their own interest.
Mabuza and Magashule featured on Dlamini-Zuma’s slate for the respective position they were elected to on Monday.
“They used a women’s campaign as a step ladder,”  Xasa said. .
