The rest of the ANC top six are: 
* David Mabuza - Deputy President (2538 votes)
* Ace Magashule - Secretary General (2336 votes)
* Jessie Duarte - Deputy Secretary General (2474 votes)
* Gwede Mantashe - Chairperson (2418 votes)
* Paul Mashatile - Treasurer-general (2517 votes)
Ramaphosa headed to the conference with a lead of 530 branch nominations after receiving a total of 1860 nominations from Limpopo, Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape.

Dlamini Zuma, for her part, received 1330 from the party’s biggest and second-biggest provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, and from Free State and North West.

The ANC's presidential position was set to be contested by seven candidates, including NEC members Jeff Radebe, Zweli Mkhize, Lindiwe Sisulu, Matthews Phosa, and Baleka Mbete, who has since thrown her weight behind Ramaphosa.

The conference got off to a bumpy start as the proceedings were mired by numerous issues, including a delay in adopting credentials. 

In the end, a total of 4776 delegates were eligible to vote after an initial 5240 had applied.
