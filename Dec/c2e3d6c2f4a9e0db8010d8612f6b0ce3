The eThekwini Municipality has announced in a statement that waste removal would continue through the festive season.
"(We) encourage residents to continue leaving their refuse for collection during the festive season as Durban Solid Waste (DSW) will adhere to the normal collection schedule. This includes on Christmas Day (December 25, 2017 and New Year’s Day (January 1, 2018)."
The DSW offices, they said, would be closed on December 25 and 26, 2017 and on January 1, 2018 but the operational staff would be on duty throughout the festive season providing services to eThekwini residents.
"Residents are reminded that DSW staff are strictly prohibited from (receiving) money or gifts from residents. Residents are also advised to be wary of con artists posing as municipal workers who have been known to solicit gifts."
They said that residents were urged to take the precaution of wrapping any glass in newspaper before disposing of it in refuse bags. 
"This will reduce the chances of injuring staff during collection."
