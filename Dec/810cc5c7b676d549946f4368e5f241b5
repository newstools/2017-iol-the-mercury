A 400% increase in items from abroad has delayed parcel delivery, says the South African Post Office.
Several Mercury readers have contacted the newspaper saying that they had been waiting months for the delivery of items ordered online, or from relatives overseas.
Head of Mail Operations at the Post Office (SAPO), Mark Van Rensburg said that the delays were due to the influx of incoming items.
“Compared to a year ago, the SA Post Office has seen a 400% increase in items from abroad, and this is delaying incoming items,” he said.
He said: "In efforts to  speed up the  processing of incoming post, an additional 40 extra staff members have been transferred to the Johannesburg international sorting centre, where all incoming post and parcels are delivered to upon arrival into South Africa."

“We have installed fibre-optic cabling at the sorting centre to speed up the network response and rate of customs clearance. This network has just been commissioned.”
SAPO, he said, had conducted an audit of the processes and found that some of the processes could have been done at the receiving post offices, where the backlog was smaller.
"The procedure has now been changed, so that these processes can be performed elsewhere in the delivery chain."
He advised customers to order items for the festive season and special occasions well in advance.


Customers with queries were requested to submit all documents such as invoices – which will help SARS with the customs clearance – to JIMCinvoiceRequired@postoffice.co.za.  Customers should include the tracking number and their contact details in the email.Customers can check on the progress with their parcels by going to www.postoffice.co.za and clicking on “track my parcel”.  They can also download the South African Post Office app on their phones, free of charge from the iTunes store and from the Google Play store.
