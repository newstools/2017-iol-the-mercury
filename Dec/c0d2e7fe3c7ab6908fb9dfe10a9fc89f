All that eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede wants for Christmas is a cleaner city.

“We cannot have Christmas in a filthy place like this. I cannot wait any longer. People are working but they are not working in a degree they should be working at,” she earlier on Monday.

Gumede decried the state of cleanliness eThekwini saying more effort needed to go into cleaning even the outskirts of the city.

She, however, thanked the city manager Sipho Nzuza for the work he has done since assuming office. Nzuza has also championed campaigns to clean the city centre. 

“I know you are supposed to be dealing more with technical issues but when I drive around the city I can see the difference that you and your team has made,” Gumede said.

Speaking during the executive committee meeting Gumede said she had noticed that in some areas tree stumps uprooted during the October storms were still lying around.

The mayor said while the priority has been on cleaning up the city centre, cleaning the outlying areas should also be pursued with the same vigour and were equally important.

She said grass-cutting and refuse removal in outlying townships like Phoenix and even rural areas needed to also be a priority.

“The stumps for trees are all over – no-one is prepared to take them. We do have teams we do have everything but our city is not coming clean,” she said.
