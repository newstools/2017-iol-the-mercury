Durban A security company posing as buyers caught a suspect allegedly selling stolen goods on classifieds website Gumtree.Investigators from Enforce Security Services, along with Durban North SAPS and their field squad, set up a sting operation to nab a man who is understood to be involved in breaking into homes and selling stolen items online. He was arrested at a petrol station near Gateway shopping mall on Saturday night. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele said the suspect had in his possession 13 computers as well as an iPad which was reported stolen in Hillcrest. Nico Potgieter, head of investigations at Enforce, said they were tipped off by a member of the public. There was a burglary in the Hillcrest area, and the complainant noticed his laptop on Gumtree and contacted us. Potgieter suspected that the arrested man was part of a larger operation, adding that further arrests were imminent. He said police were questioning one suspect, who is a foreign national, who will shed light on more suspects. Potgieter said the arrest was down to teamwork between police and private security. We re all ex-SAPS members who have the experience and informer network. Working hand-in-hand, we can curb these crimes.&quot; The Mercury
