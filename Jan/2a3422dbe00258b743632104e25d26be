Durban The ANC Youth League has accused Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan of using state-owned entities as cash cows for companies allegedly linked to them.These allegations were made by the national youth league leadership, including president Collen Maine, at the St George Hotel in Irene, Pretoria, on Wednesday.It was the same venue where the ANC s national executive committee lekgotla was under way to map a way forward for the party following its January 8 statement. The youth league, however, chose to single out Ramaphosa and Gordhan as being responsible for the increasing number of jobless black people in the country.The allegations came after Independent Media asked the youth leadership to clarify the call by its eThekwini region for the sacking of Gordhan. That call was later retracted but the national leadership revived it.ANC Youth League national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said: We accept the apology of KZN, but agree with the content of what they were saying. If you look at SAA at close range, you find service providers who ve been doing business with them since 1973 and they are still being prioritised. Pravin Gordhan as minister of finance appointed consultants Seabury to conduct a turnaround strategy at SAA.&quot;&quot;What did (aviation consultants) Seabury do? It appointed Bidvest, a company linked to Ramaphosa.&quot; SAA was later told to close some of its lucrative routes such as the London route. A plan was made for Comair to take over that route. Comair is owned by British Airways and Pravin (Gordhan) has a 20% stake in Comair, Mkhize said.The youth league said it would campaign for the return of SAA to the Public Enterprise Ministry.Reacting to the allegations, Ramaphosa s spokesperson, Ronnie Mamoepa, said: &quot;The deputy president has disposed of all his interests that may have created a conflict of interest upon assumption of his duties as deputy president.&quot;Political Bureau
