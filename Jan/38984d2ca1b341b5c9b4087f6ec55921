Durban Seven years after Irishman John King was beaten to death in a Durban nightclub, police are determined that the man who allegedly carried out the attack finally goes on trial for the murder.The man, Travis Nel, who had been living in the UK, was arrested last week after he arrived at OR Tambo International Airport.According to a source close to the investigation, King was found dead on August 2, 2009, in what was then the Eighties nightclub, after a rugby match between South Africa and New Zealand at Kings Park rugby stadium.He was initially thought to have died from natural causes, but an autopsy later revealed that he had been assaulted.Forty-year-old King, who was from Ireland but also held American citizenship, had been in South Africa on business at the time.He had been working on a hydroelectric dam in Ladysmith.Nel, who is from South Africa but lives in the UK, was visiting Durban at the time and was a suspect, but he returned to the UK before he could be arrested.He came back to South Africa in March 2010, when he was arrested by investigating officer Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Booysen and charged with King s murder.He was granted bail and ordered to surrender his passport.However, his bail conditions were later relaxed because of family-related issues, and he was allowed to return to the UK on strict conditions, including that he maintained contact with local authorities.Nel s case was dealt with in absentia for some time but, owing to a technicality, the charges against him were provisionally withdrawn some years ago.Police established that Nel had returned to South Africa, undetected, in January last year, and he was subsequently flagged for movement control.On Christmas Eve, they got wind that he was on a flight from Frankfurt, in Germany, headed for Johannesburg.Nel was detained at OR Tambo airport and then transported back to Durban, where he was released on R600 bail.He appeared in the Durban Magistrate s Court last Wednesday without a lawyer, but said he would be represented by attorney Carl van der Merwe. The State said the charges had been reinstated and the matter had to be adjourned for his lawyer to appear. The court also heard that he had surrendered his passport to authorities, and magistrate Mahomed Motala ordered that it remain in the possession of the authorities until the matter was finalised.He was also ordered not to leave KwaZulu-Natal without giving the investigating officer 48 hours notice.The case was adjourned until later this month.The Mercury
