DURBAN Police are investigating the death of former golf star Wayne Westner, who shot and killed himself on Wednesday morning. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident and said an inquest had been opened after the 55-year-old man allegedly shot himself in front of his wife following a reported domestic dispute in Pennington on the South Coast. His body was removed shortly after the incident at 8am to the KZN Medico-Legal Mortuary (MLM) in Park Rynie for a post-mortem examination. More information was not immediately available. Westner, as reported on his website, was the inventor of golf training machine Instant Golfer. He won 14 professional tournaments, including two South African Opens, two European Tour events and the 1996 World Cup of Golf (where he partnered with Ernie Els). His career was cut short in 1998 because of an injury.[email&#160;protected]Independent Media
