Durban The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal is threatening to shut down Absa branches every month-end until the bank pays back what it owes .On Thursday about 500 young people picketed outside the Absa branch in Durban CBD , according to KZN provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabela. There were also pickets in Kokstad in the Harry Gwala region, but from next month there will be pickets outside every Absa branch in the province until the shareholder pays back the money, said Sabelo. Today we dealt with the branch manager, we are expecting a response from the shareholder, he said. The Youth League has decided to picket following the leaking of the public protector s report which stated that the bank owes more than R2.5m to the government. It has been reported that Absa could be forced to pay R2.25 billion to the fiscus for an unlawful apartheid-era bank bailout. The money is part of the so-called Lifeboat loans that was loaned to the Bancorp group bank that was acquired by Absa in around 1995. Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has suggested that the president should consider a commission of inquiry into apartheid-era looting of the fiscus. That money could be used for the development in the country and it could be used to fund free education, said Sabelo. The Mercury
