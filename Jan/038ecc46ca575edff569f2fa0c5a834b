Durban - A woman was bust trying to sneak in dagga to a man being held at Port Shepstone police station in a container containing stew.Police spokesman Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane said the 20-year-old woman arrived at the police station on New Year's Day, wanting to bring food to a 30-year-old man who had been detained for possession of dagga.The visitor asked the officers on duty to hand the food to the prisoner, but their suspicion may have been raised by the aromas emanating from the container.&quot;The members who were on duty, smelled a rat and started searching the cooked stew in the ice cream container,&quot; said Zwane.They found three parcels of dagga wrapped in plastic hidden inside the stew. &quot;Upon further scrutinising a plastic bag which was filled with biscuits, they discovered that the biscuits were laced with dagga leaves.&quot;Zwane said the suspect was arrested and detained. She will appear soon in the Port Shepstone Magistrate's Court.The Mercury
