We hope the systems are quite good and get the generation capacity that we are anticipating. That would be fantastic for us to plan for a larger roll-out, said Ntshalintshali.The Energy Office Solar project has seen the three-phase project installing Solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels on five municipal buildings.
