Durban The owner of the truck that ploughed into vehicles on Field s Hill in 2013, killing 24 people, made a brief appearance in the Verulam Magistrate s Court on Monday. The legal team of Gregory Govender, the owner of Sagekal Logistics CC, will make representations to the court on February 7 after the case was once again postponed, said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara. Govender faces charges relating to the contravention of the National Road Traffic Act, the Immigration Act, and operating an unroadworthy vehicle. On September 5, 2013, the truck careened down the M13 and crashed into four taxis and two cars at the bottom of Field s Hill.Govender was not initially charged, but it emerged during the bail application of the driver, Sanele May, that the truck was not roadworthy and that May was an illegal immigrant from Swaziland. Govender was initially summonsed to court in June last year, and made his first appearance a month later. His case has since been postponed several times. May had entered the country illegally and without a work permit. He was convicted of 24 counts of culpable homicide after pleading guilty and was sentenced to eight years in prison in November 2014.
