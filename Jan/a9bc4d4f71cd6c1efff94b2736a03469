Durban Authorities have urged the public to report incidents of objects being hurled on to vehicles after a KwaMashu man reported that a rock was thrown at his windscreen on the N2 highway on Monday.Mduduzi Nxumalo, told The Mercury on Wednesday that he had been driving on the N2 under the Higginson Highway bridge, south of Durban, on Monday morning when an object was thrown on to his Opel Corsa bakkie, smashing his windscreen. Nxumalo, a businessman, said he had not yet reported the incident to police. I felt something hitting my windscreen and glass hit me all over. I thought someone was shooting at me, he said. He said he managed to keep calm in heavy traffic, and immediately went to get the windscreen repaired. Nxumalo wrote about his incident on a Durban crime group on Facebook. It has been shared more than 130 times. I wanted to try and save lives. I put it out there for others to be aware. Layton Beard, a spokesperson for the Automobile Association, advised anyone in this situation to report it to the police immediately. Keep as calm as you can, and try to avoid swerving. It is also good to travel at a speed that is right for the conditions of the road, and wear a seatbelt and ensure others are wearing seatbelts. He said Nxumalo was lucky to escape unscathed. Lots of people, unfortunately, roll their cars in these incidents. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said: There were cases like this in the past where people have died. Zwane urged the victim to report it to police. He said police do not get complaints of this kind often.He said offenders could face charges relating to damage to the vehicle and assault if the person was injured.The Mercury
