Durban The DA and KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube are at each other s throats, following a call by the opposition party for the MEC to resign with immediate effect for allegedly using her political muscle to derail the management of uMsunduzi Municipality in Pietermaritzburg.DA MP Mergan Chetty started the fire by alleging that Dube-Ncube had launched an investigation that led to the purging of former uMsunduzi municipal manager Mxolisi Nkosi, who was not in the good books of the current leadership of the ANC in the province.Nkosi this week told a Pietermaritzburg-based newspaper that his lengthy suspension until his dismissal late last month was connected to his declaration made before the ANC provincial conference, and that he was supporting former premier Senzo Mchunu to be re-elected as ANC provincial chairman. He told the newspaper he was suspended after the newly elected ANC leadership instructed Dube-Ncube to institute an investigation against him. The haste with which the MEC recommended an investigation acted as a smokescreen to justify her faction s preference to remove Mr Nkosi, who by his own admission was part of the dethroned Senzo Mchunu s camp.&quot; By using her position and political influence to deal with people who are opposed to her, the MEC has shown she has no interest in fostering good governance in failing municipalities, said Chetty.Chetty called on Premier Willies Mchunu, ANC provincial deputy chairperson, to do the right thing and place the interest of residents ahead of his comrades by recalling MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. A department statement issued last February said the department had damning allegations brought to its attention by various whistle-blowers to get to the bottom of these allegations, Cogta has resolved to institute an investigation. Dube-Ncube s office did not take Chetty s allegations lying down and released a statement labelling him a public fool . Dube-Ncube s spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, said his boss had launched investigations at various municipalities in response to constant requests from the DA. What we must ask is, what is sparking this overnight about-turn and change of heart? said Mabaso.He said through initiating investigations and uncovering misconduct, Dube-Ncube had brought stability to many municipalities.
