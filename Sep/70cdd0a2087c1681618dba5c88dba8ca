Testifying before Marumo Moerane on Thursday morning is SACP provincial chairman James Nxumalo, his deputy Nomvuzo Shabalala and provincial secretary Themba Mthembu, who will be making submissions on behalf of the party, that is known to be at loggerheads with the ANC leadership.
Both Nxumalo and Shabalala are former eThekwini municipal mayor and deputy mayor respectively while Mthembu, is the MEC for agriculture and rural development department.  
He said that he hoped that the commission would be different from previous commission by coming up with solutions to the political violence in the province.
"People of KwaZulu-Natal have been known to look for solutions to their political differences through violence," he said.
It is expected that the three will refer to the tragedy in Nxumalo’s home village of Inchanga where 11 people were killed prior to and after local government elections in August last year.
The SACP’s testimony followed that of former ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairman Senzo Mchunu, who appeared on Wednesday, and spent about five hours testifying.
The commission was set up by Premier Willies Mchunu to probe political killings in the province.
