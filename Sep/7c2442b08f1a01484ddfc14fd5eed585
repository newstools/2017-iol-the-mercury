Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the victim and his passenger were in their stationary vehicle at Palmview robot near Verulam, when they had been approached by two unknown armed suspects. 
“The suspects allegedly jumped into the vehicle and forced the driver to go to Cornubia. 
While driving, it is alleged that one of the suspects fired a shot injuring the passenger. 
“The bullet also hit one of the suspects. Seeing that one of the suspects was injured, they forced the driver to stop and they fled the scene.”
Zwane explained that the injured suspect, 30, could not run further, leading to the other suspect leaving him behind. 
“Community members heard the injured suspect crying and they called the police who arrested him. 
He was taken to hospital where he later died of his injuries. Charges of carjacking and attempted murder were opened at Verulam police station.”
The other suspect is still at large.
