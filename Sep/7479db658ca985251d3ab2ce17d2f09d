Crisis Medical’s marketing manager Kyle van Reenen said in a statement that at 11.45 pm paramedics were called to the scene of the serious motor vehicle collision on the M4 Ruth First Highway, in the vicinity of the Swapo Road, Broadway area. 
“Reports from the scene indicate that whilst the members of the South African and Metro Police Services were conducting a roadblock operation, a vehicle travelling at high speed, disregarded the early warning measures, smashing into the rear of another stationary vehicle, whilst policemen clambered to safety.”
He said that three occupants of the stationary vehicle sustained injuries, with one suffering serious injury. 
“Advanced life support paramedics worked to stabilise the man, before he was placed onto a specialised stretcher for the prevention of further spinal cord injuries and transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital for the specialist care he required.”
Van Reenen said two other occupants had suffered moderate injury and were treated and stabilised, before being taken to nearby hospitals.
The offending driver, he said, did not sustain any injury and was arrested.
In a separate incident on the same highway, said Van Reenen, a man believed to be in his late forties, lost his life. 
“His vehicle was found to have careened off the roadway into dense bushes. 
The man suffered fatal traumatic injuries and there was nothing Paramedics could do to assist.”
