MORE than half of households in South Africa that have been hit by crime in the past year, have been victims of housebreaking and/or burglary according to the Stats SA Victims of Crime Survey (VOCS).The survey, published on Thursday, looks at the crime trends in the country for the year 2016-17. It looks at individual crimes and household crimes and the common crimes that continue to create an atmosphere of fear among the country's citizens.It found that the crime rate in the country was in the decline, although this was at a very slow pace. There was still a very high general feeling among the population of being  unsafe, especially when walking at night.The VOCS found that housebreaking and burglary were followed by theft of livestock, poultry and other animals owned by the household, as well as home robbery.“It is estimated that over 54 percent of households lost electronic equipment while 29 percent of households lost cellphones during housebreakings in 2016/17. The least likely items to be stolen were travelling bags, which about 11 percent of households are estimated to have lost in 2016/17 during housebreakings,” said the report.It also found that “randomly selected individuals aged 16 years and above were most likely to be victims of theft of personal property, followed by robbery and assault.”It found that male headed households were most likely to be victimised as compared with female-headed households.
