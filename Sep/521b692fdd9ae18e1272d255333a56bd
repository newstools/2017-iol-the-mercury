Durban - About 4000 Cosatu members participated in the Durban leg of the Cosatu march on Wednesday. The march started at the King Dinuzulu park this morning and made its way to the Durban City Hall. Led by Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini and the secretary of the SACP in KZN, Themba Mthembu, the marchers arrived at the city Hall just after 1.30pm. The march is part of the nationwide anti-state capture  and anti-corruption strike action by the union federation which is also in an alliance with the ANC.   Cosatu provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize said he was satisfied with the turnout despite it being lower than what was initially anticipated. Cosatu and the SACP said the march was not about support of a certain faction within the ANC but some marchers sang songs in support of ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and those slating President Jacob Zuma and the controversial Gupta family.  “Ama Gupta ayizinja (The Guptas are dogs),” went one of the songs. Some of the marchers were clad in CR17 regalia, including caps and T-shirts which were also sold by hawkers at the march. CR17 is the name of Ramaphosa’s presidential campaign.The Mercury
