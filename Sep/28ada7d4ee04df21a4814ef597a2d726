The clothes Zanele Hlatshwayo was wearing when she disappeared were found in the house after Mbatha handed himself over to police, confessing to cannibalism in August. 
According to her family, Hlatshwayo left home in Shayamoya on July 25, leaving her 2-year-old son. She was headed for Pietermaritzburg to visit a relative.

Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said on Tuesday the results of a DNA test had confirmed that the body parts were those of Hlatshwayo. 
Mbatha and his co-accused Sithembiso Sithole, Lindokuhle Masondo, Lungisani Magubane and Khayelihle Lamula abandoned their bail application when they appeared at the Estcourt Magistrates Court. They had to be whisked away from the courthouse as hundreds of people gathered outside baying for blood.
