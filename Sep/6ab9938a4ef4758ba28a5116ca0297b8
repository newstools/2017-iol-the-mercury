Two people were seriously injured in an accident involving a minibus taxi in Verulam north of Durban on Monday morning. Netcare spokesperson Nick Dollman said the company’s paramedics responded just before 7am to reports of a very serious crash in Ireland street in Verulam. “Reports from the injured passengers allege that the minibus taxi was unable to negotiate the curve near the corner of Ireland and Todd streets and crashed down an embankment and rolled before coming to rest in the car park area of a local shop.” Dollman noted that the incident and preceding events would form part of a police investigation. He said paramedics from Netcare 911 and other private ambulance services attended to 11 patients, two of whom had sustained serious injuries, with the others sustaining injuries that ranged from relatively minor to moderate.  “Netcare 911 transported three patients from the scene, including one of the seriously injured passengers. He is a 37-year-old man and was attended to by a Netcare 911 Advanced Life Support Paramedic and analgesic medication was administered to control his pain,” said Dollman. The Fire Department and the SAPS also attended the scene.
