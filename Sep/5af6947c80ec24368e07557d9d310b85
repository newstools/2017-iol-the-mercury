It is understood that two classrooms and a staff room were gutted but the rest of the school appears functional.
Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said on Tuesday that the matrics' trial exams were continuing, with a heavy police presence at the school.
But he said that teaching and learning had been disrupted and some classes cancelled.
Mthethwa said the department was planning a meeting with all stakeholders on Friday.
Last month, three pupils were suspended from George Campbell Technical High School, in Durban, after protest action against victimization and institutionalized racism turned ugly.
