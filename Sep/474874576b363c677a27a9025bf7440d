LONDON: A British family called up animal welfare to report a terrifying creature hiding out under a bed in their home, only to find that it was in fact a dirty sock.Animal Collection Officer Vic Hurr, from the RSPCA charity, said she had warily approached the “lizard” after being alerted to its presence by alarmed family members in Coventry last Friday.“It was protruding from the edge of the bed and it wasn’t moving at all,” Hurr said. “As it wasn’t very light, I got out my torch to see better and that’s when I realised it wasn’t a lizard at all.”Hurr said she had left the family with some guidance, and a warning.“I advised the young girl whose bedroom it was to tidy her room and to take care of her socks, but not before reminding her that another one will turn up soon as they are usually in pairs,” she said.According to The Telegraph, an RSPCA spokesperson commented: "It was definitely one of our more unusual call-outs. The family called us in a bit of a panic, they were terrified a lizard had got into their house."It was obviously dark in the room and I think fear just set in. But they said it had been there for about a week and hadn't moved in that time."The sock had obviously been there quite a while. It was a typical teenager's bedroom, I suppose." - AP
