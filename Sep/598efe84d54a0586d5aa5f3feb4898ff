Shortly before 7am on Sunday, paramedics from ER24 and the local fire department arrived on the scene on the R617 in Boston, said the emergency medical service spokesman Werner Vermaak in a statement. 
“They found the truck and trailer overturned on the side of the road. 
The cabin of the truck was crushed and both men were trapped inside of it. According to the men, the incident occurred about an hour before someone came across the incident.”
The paramedics and fire fighters joined forces to stabilise the cabin and free the trapped men. 
“Both were lucky to have sustained only moderate injuries. Once freed, they were transported by ER24 and EMRS to Edendale Hospital for further care.”
Vermaak said that the exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not yet known.
On Saturday, a man, believed to be in his early thirties, was killed on the N3 south near Hammarsdale.
“Shortly before 1am, paramedics arrived on the scene where they found the pedestrian lying the middle of the road. Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead on the scene.””
The occupants of the vehicle that collided with the pedestrian did not sustain any injuries.
