Inspired by their recent film, Beyond The River, the values-inspired campaign called What’s Your Story, will address ideas around culture, identity and racial stereotypes.
“The Bell Pottinger scandal made South Africans wake up and see that we need to take charge of our South African narrative. If we don’t stop to ask, listen and tell our own stories, ones that promote tolerance and understanding, more Bell Pottingers will fill the gaps with stories that breed ignorance and fear. Fake news is an unfortunate reality,” said Heartlines’ chief executive Dr Garth Japhet.
The body said in a statement that all South Africans were guardians of "our collective culture". 
“Heritage Month is the perfect time for all South Africans to reflect on the current narrative around culture and who owns it. That’s why mass media campaigns like What’s Your Story? are so important – they empower ordinary South Africans to share ideas around culture and identity and by so doing create new narratives.”
Japhet said: “The personal stories of every citizen and community in South Africa contribute to our national heritage. The more we understand each other’s stories and the stories of our communities, the more we understand, accept and empathise with each other.”
Aimed at giving one million people a platform for their stories to be heard, Heartlines have launched a crowdfunding campaign. 
Money raised will go towards implementing What’s your Story? throughout South Africa, as well as community film viewings of Beyond the River.
