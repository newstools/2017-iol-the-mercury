on Thursday.

Dlamini Zuma said radical economic transformation would create a society of not just job seekers, but also creators. “If we don’t do that, there are going to be generations of women who are still going to suffer like we do.

“In South Africa, we locate women’s economic empowerment in the context of radical economic transformation,” she said.

Dlamini Zuma said the country would not succeed in tackling unemployment, poverty and inequality if women were not part of driving that agenda. 

“No country can boast of being free until it tackles gender inequality. We need the structure, ownership and management of our economy to be representative of all South Africans,” she added.

During her address, Dlamini Zuma said South Africa’s economy was controlled by a few and this structure needed to be dismantled in order to allow those sidelined, especially black women, a stake in the economy.

She said government should ensure their procurement processes are designed so that they source what they need from businesses owned by women.

“We need greater financial inclusion and to actively participate in the economy,” she concluded.

Durban mayor, Zandile Gumede, said she was committed to shaping a just future where women could benefit.

“When I leave office, I need to count the number of women I have elevated through policy intervention.

“We as women in leadership roles should never be afraid of changing policies as long as previously oppressed women will benefit,” she said.
