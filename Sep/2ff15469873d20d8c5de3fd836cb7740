"Women are under-utilised and underestimated yet they are the hardest working and the most resilient," she said.
Dlamini Zuma said the history of oppression of the black majority through colonialism and apartheid affected women three times more than it did men.
"During apartheid women were treated like minors. We could not own property and needed men to act as surety to even buy a car.





"As a result of patriarchy the pay gap between women and men still persists," she explained.
She said despite the gains made in the women empowerment movement, more still needs to be done and  at a faster pace.
She said through radical economic transformation, gender equality would be realised quicker.





"Radical economic transformation will unlock our potential and create a society of not just job seekers but also creators."
Dlamini Zuma said women, particularly black women, should be part of a skills revolution in the cultural ,creative, agricultural and mining industries amongst others.
"We need greater financial inclusion and to actively participate in the economy.





"Why can’t we as women come together," she asked.
Dlamini Zuma said women must organise, change their attitudes and use their consumer power to demand change where they want change.
