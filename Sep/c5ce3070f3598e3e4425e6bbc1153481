Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said in a statement that on Saturday Pietermaritzburg K9 unit members arrested the suspects and also recovered a stolen vehicle. 
“Police were conducting an operation on the N3 freeway near Merrivale when they spotted a vehicle with five occupants. When police instructed them to stop, the suspects allegedly tried to veer the police vehicle off the road.”
The vehicle crashed onto the pavement and the suspects abandoned it while shooting at the police. 
“Suspects disappeared into the bushes and police gave chase. 
Two of the five suspects were arrested and taken to hospital for medical attention under police guard.
They will be charged and will appear at Howick Magistrate’s Court soon.”
Mbhele said that during an investigation, it was revealed that the vehicle had been stolen during a house robbery incident at Sdikidikeni area, Intsikeni. 
“These suspects will also be profiled to determine if they can be linked to other similar incidents.”
