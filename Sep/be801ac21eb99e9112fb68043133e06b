The police officer who was arrested with former Durban Hawks boss Colonel Rajen Aiyer last month, is a free man. Captain Dhanpal Mundree appeared alongside Aiyer in the Durban Magistrate’s court on Thursday morning, when the State announced it was withdrawing the charges against him. The State did not explain why it had taken this decision but Aiyer still stands accused of perjury and defeating the ends of justice. His case has been transferred to a regional court and will come before a magistrate again in October. Aiyer and Mundree were arrested by investigators from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate in early August, on charges relating to a false statement made in connection with a robbery case in which Aiyer was one of the complainants. They were both released on R1000 bail. Aiyer was at one stage thought to be central to the State’s case against officers from the Durban Organised Crime Unit who have been charged in connection with allegedly running a "death squad".
