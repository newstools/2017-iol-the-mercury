We discovered these membership in Nongoma. They were using a different stamp than the one that we use.‚ÄùHe said those fraudulent members could influence the party's election."What happens is that some ANC regional leaders would then sideline the real branches of the party in favour of these bogus branches, and that will result in a leadership that is not legitimate being elected," said Mkhwanazi.He said after discovering fraudulent membership, they had reported the matter to the provincial leadership and the national leaders."We are still waiting for the response from the national office of the ANC," said Mkhwanazi.He said they had also reported the matter to the police.ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party was investigating allegations of membership fraud in the Zululand area."We know of allegations involving around 1000 membership that we are investigating.
