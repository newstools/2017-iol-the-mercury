The municipality said in a statement via their Facebook group on Thursday that the areas of Hibberdene, Woodgrange, Stickfarm, Anerley, Southport, Umzumbe, Melville and Sunwichport were still experiencing water supply interruptions. 
These areas were all supplied from the same pipeline.
“Restoration time is currently unknown but work is in progress to reinstate supply. Static tanks that are filled are available for relief supply while we work to restore supply.”
In the Marburg, Merlewood, Mkholombe and Bhobhoyi Jesus areas, following the troubleshooting process, they suspected a break on the downstream side. 
“We estimate that normal supply in these areas will be fully restored by Friday morning. In the interim, we have provided static tanks for relief supply which are being filled regularly. We are also providing the industrial factories in this area with water while work continues to fully restore the supply.”
They said Merlewood was back on line. 
"However, the (other areas) still remain affected. Work is continuing on the ground to ensure capacity is build up in the Marburg Reservoir."
In Port Edward, a burst pipe was found on a pipeline leading to Command Reservoir that feeds Port Edward. 
“Work is in progress to restore supply. We expect full restoration of supply by (Thursday).
Some parts of Margate and KwaNositha were experiencing interruptions as a result of the vandalism of the Kaisers Pump Station.
