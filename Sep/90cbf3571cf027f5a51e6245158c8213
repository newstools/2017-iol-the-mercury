Durban - ANC presidential hopeful Zweli Mkhize has emphasised the importance of uniting the divided ANC, saying the upcoming national conference of the party should elect unifying leaders.
Speaking at the OR Tambo Memorial lecture held at the Olive Convention Centre in Durban on Sunday, the ANC treasurer general said a united party would also disempower the many splinter organisations formed by its former members.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“If we build unity we will also decimate other organisations that were created out of anger,” he said. 

Mkhize is campaigning to be president of the ANC and has styled his campaign on unity. He also called on leaders to distance themselves from the factions.

The leadership of the SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in KZN also threw its weight behind Mkhize.

Addressing the same gathering, Richard Mkhungo endorsed Mkhize, saying he managed to unify the ANC in KZN when he was still its chairperson. Therefore, he would also be able to unite the ANC if elected as president. 

Sanco has in the past endorsed Cyril Ramaphosa. But Mkhungo said the national executive committee of Sanco would make a decision on who to back as a candidate after listening to the views of the branches.

Mkhize said the branches of the ANC had a responsibility to ensure that the party was not led by leaders who were accused of corruption and arrogance. 

“What we must tell our people is that this ANC is still ­capable of self-correction.”
