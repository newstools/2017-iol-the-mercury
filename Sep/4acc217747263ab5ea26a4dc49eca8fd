Durban - DA spokesperson on Health DR Imran Keeka said he was shocked that the KZN Department of Health had again been flagged by the Auditor General for “poor management of its finances”.The AG’s report released on Tuesday to Health Portfolio Committee members revealed that while the department had been able to rein in unauthorised expenditure for the 2016/17 financial year, it faced serious challenges.Irregular expenditure increased from R4.3 billion to R7.1bn while fruitless and wasteful expenditure has risen from R8.9 million to just short of R15m over the last financial year.“On the parliamentary responses, I had asked about this and the response was that the MEC gets monthly reports on this.“Treasury had also stated that they had placed someone in the department full time to assist, but instead of things improving, they are getting worse. The problems in the department are not new,” said Keeka.  The AG’s reports stated that the department had failed to keep proper records detailing close to R 1 billion spent on commuted overtime allowance.The report was not discussed by the members of the committee on Tuesday after MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo did not arrive for the meeting at the Legislature.Attempts to get comment from the department were unsuccessful.The Mercury
