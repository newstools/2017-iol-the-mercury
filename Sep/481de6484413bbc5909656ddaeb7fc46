Durban - Whispers of “murderers” and “no bail” were heard as three of the men accused of stabbing 63-year-old former school principal Gona Pillay to death, appeared at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.Real estate agent  “Basil” Underhill Jnr - whose real name is Lungani - quickly cast his eyes to the floor as he stood into the dock.His co-accused - Fred “Boy” Msomi and Braveman Underhill, thought to be a cousin of Underhill’s - followed his lead.The case was adjourned until next week for a formal bail application, which the State is expected to oppose.The three are facing charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravated circumstances.It is understood that Pillay and her husband, Logie, were planning on selling their Silverglen home and let four people - whom they thought were potential buyers - in, to have a look, last Wednesday.But once in, the group turned on the elderly couple.They stabbed and robbed them before fleeing in their Mercedes Benz.Pillay died at the scene and Logie was rushed to hospital.He was discharged so he could attend his wife’s funeral at the weekend but has since been readmitted.The three men who are currently before the court, were arrested separately over the course of the last week.The fourth is still at large.A neighbour of the Pillays, who did not want to be named, said she was living in fear.At first, she said, she could barely believe what had happened.“It’s a quiet area. We were all shocked,” she said.Govender described the Pillays as a well-respected and highly educated couple.She said their house had been locked up since last Wednesday.More crime and courtsThe Mercury
