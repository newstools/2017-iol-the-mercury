Van Heerden, 25, from the Western Cape, will be competing against 123 other hopefuls from other countries in the competition which is watched worldwide by almost one billion people.
“The 67th Miss World competition takes place at the Crown of Beauty Theatre in Sanya, China (People's Republic of China), on November 18 when Puerto Rico’s Stephanie Del Valle will crown her successor at the end of the event,” said organisers Sun International in a statement.
Van Heerden, they said, was a second lieutenant in the South African Military Health Services and comes from Herold’s Bay.
She has won Protea colours in rhythmic gymnastics and was a gold medal winner at the All African Championships. 
Her extramural activities include boxing and hiking, as well as baking. 
“I could not have asked for a more incredible opportunity and am determined to give it my all and make our country proud. I look forward to sharing with the world my passion to protect and heal human kind,” she said.
Pageant coach and fashion stylist Werner Wessels and Miss South Africa stylist Noreen Kajee-Vareta, said the statement, would assist Van Heerden ahead of her departure.
The contest, they explained, received a facelift  this year with the introduction of Head to Head Challenge events which took place between October 21 and November 15 at different locations visited by the contestants.
“Twenty groups of six (sometimes seven) countries will compete with the winner of each group automatically qualifying for the Miss World Top 40. 
This comprises the 20 Head to Head Challenge winners, five fast track event winners and 15 selected by the judges.”
