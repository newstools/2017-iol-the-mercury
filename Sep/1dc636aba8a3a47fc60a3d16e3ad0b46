The suspects, aged 24 and 28, are accused of allegedly killing Mthokozisi Khoza, 26, at Shikishela, reserve, in the Bhekamandla area near KwaMsane in August. 
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said in a statement on Monday that it was alleged that Khoza and the suspects were at the Bukhosini homestead where a traditional ceremony had been taking place when a dispute ensued. 
“The suspects fought against Khoza and he sustained several stab wounds at the back and under the right shoulder. He was then taken with a private vehicle to a local hospital but died on the way. The suspects fled the scene but were later tracked down on the same day and arrested with the help of the community.”
KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa praised the police and community for arresting the suspects. 
“We will ensure that the case is properly investigated so that the suspects will be convicted and sentenced accordingly. We applauded the members of the community for working with the police in making sure the suspects are arrested.”
