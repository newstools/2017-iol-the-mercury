DURBAN - KWAZULU-NATAL top cop Brigadier Tefo Mpete, 54, a man of action and results would rather encourage his members to shoot back in defence when under fire rather than giving in to criminals.
The KZN head of the operational command centre, Mpete formed the Trio task team earlier this year to combat violent crimes and tackle aggravated robberies around the province.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

A passionate motorbike rider and member of the Lutheran church, Mpete, who starts his day with a prayer to motivate his team, said the brazen attacks on police during  recent heists were “ruthless”, making it necessary that police fight back in defence.

He was commenting on the recent deaths of 15 alleged armed robbers who were killed in shootouts with police in 
separate incidents last month. 

“We are absolutely under siege by criminals. They are heartless people who are not scared to shoot at the police in the presence of innocent civilians,” he said.

Mpete was satisfied with the work of his team, saying there was a definite decline in violent crime although he could not share statistics. He was optimistic that the crime stats, due for release later this month, would paint a positive picture after 2015/2016 crime reports recorded 137 cash-in-transit heists in the country. 

A father of three, he was born in Krugersdorp and moved to KZN 12 years ago where he was in charge of the Phoenix police station.  

Mpete commended his men in blue for standing firm against criminals. He defended the killing of criminals, saying police only did so in self-
defence. 

“In cases where they have acted unlawfully we refer them to Ipid (Independent Police Investigative Directorate) for investigation. We have arrested members who have colluded with criminals,” he said.
