She said people living in low-lying areas were urged to take precautions as localised flooding was a possible risk.
The province, she explained, had traditionally borne the brunt of inclement weather conditions that routinely left a trail of death and destruction in their wake through localised flooding, hail storms, lightning strikes and veld fires, all of which tended to cause millions of rand in damages to public infrastructure and private property.
“We can assure the general public that a great deal of effort is always made by the department to ensure that each weather warning is acted upon appropriately and that important information is cascaded down to municipalities and other authorities in areas that are prone to weather-related incidents.”
