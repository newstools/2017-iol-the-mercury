The men appeared briefly on Tuesday afternoon, when they were remanded into police custody ahead of a formal bail application next week.
The State is opposing their bail.

According to reports, the Pillays were planning on selling their home and were under the impression that the men had been potential buyers.
They let the group in – amongst them, one thought to be a real estate agent – to look at it.
The men then reportedly turned on them, attacking and robbing them before fleeing in the couple’s car.
The car was recovered in uMbumbulu, south of Durban, along with the weapon believed to have been used in the stabbings.
A small group of protesters were at court on Tuesday, with signs reading “No Bail”.
