Durban - More than eight years after taxi boss Bongani Mkhize was killed by police, the KwaZulu-Natal taxi boss’s family has been awarded R3 million in damages. In terms of a negotiated settlement which was made an order of the Pietermaritzburg High Court this week, the police have one month to pay his family.Mkhize’s wife and children had initially claimed R2.3m for the loss of his support.But on Tuesday their lawyer, Petrus Coetzee, said they had secured more information over the course of proceedings and given it to a team of experts.He said an actuary had calculated the final amount.Coetzee said the family was relieved that the civil case was finally over.Mkhize was killed in a shootout with police in Umgeni Road, Durban, in February 2009.At the time, police said he had been linked to the murder of traditional leader Mbongeleni Zondi, head of the Zondi clan, who was killed in Umlazi in 2009 and that Mkhize had opened fire on them first.But Mkhize’s death was labelled “suspicious” by criminologists as it came just three months after he obtained a high court interdict against the police to stop them from killing him.The determination of the amount of damages had been set down for argument a few weeks ago, before the parties settled.The Mkhize family declined to comment yesterday. The Mercury
