A woman – accused of killing and dismembering another woman – will soon apply for the bail at the Ixopo Magistrate's Court.
She is implicated in the grisly murder of Nomthandazo Dlamini, 22, whose body – missing its head and arms – was found on Sunday.
The 39-year-old woman appeared at court on Wednesday, where the matter was postponed until September 18.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Dlamini left her Donnybrook home with a man on Thursday last week.
The next day – after she had still not come home – her family became worried and started to look for her. 
When they were unsuccessful in finding her, the matter was reported to the local police and a search was conducted with the assistance of the community members. 
“On September 10 ,the body was found next to the road at Sunrise Forest in the area with severe injuries. It appeared that she was hacked with a bush knife.”
Zwane said both her arms and head were missing.
“A case of murder was opened at Donnybrook police station for further investigation.” Zwane explained that, through the investigation, the suspect was arrested on the same day and took the police to where she had been keeping the victim’s arms. 
“Only one arm was found. The second arm and head are still missing. The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court.”
