Silence Jabulani Mkwakwa, 39, Lucas Siduduzo Mthembu, 40, and Khayelihle Mzila, 29, appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, following their arrest on Tuesday while guarding Mandeni Municipality Mayor Siphesihle Zulu. 
The men were not represented in court but told Magistrate Mohamed Motala that their employer had told them a lawyer was on the way. 
However, there was no need to wait as senior state prosecutor Herman Mouton indicated that he was not opposed to their release on warning. 
Each man confirmed that they did not have a criminal record nor any pending cases.
WATCH: Bodyguards call to 'kill the dog'
Following their arrest in Mount Edgecombe, police issued a statement in which Minister of Police  Fikile Mbalula congratulated the Hawks members from Durban Organised Crime, particularly the National Bureau for Illegal Firearms Crimes and Priority Violent Crimes and National Intervention Unit for making the arrests.
The statement said the three bodyguards were employed by the same security company as the two men caught on camera brandishing guns and seemingly threatening to “get rid of the dog”.
They were later confirmed to be bodyguards for ANC in Ethekwini region secretary Bheki Ntuli, who distanced himself from the video.
