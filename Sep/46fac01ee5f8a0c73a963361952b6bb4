On January 20 at 9.30pm, said police in a statement, six people were at their homestead in Georgedale, Hammarsdale when they were attacked by five unknown suspects armed with handguns. 
“It is alleged that they came to the homestead looking for one of the family members. When the door were opened the suspects allegedly opened fire killing six people and injuring one who was taken to hospital.”
The deceased, they said, were later identified as Hlengiwe Kubheka, 20, Siyanda Kubheka, 26, Nonhlanhla Mbhele, 22), Sphamandla Mavundla, 27, Mcebisi Gondwe, 29, and Sphelele Kubheka, 37. 
“Six counts of murder and attempted murder were opened at Hammarsdale police station.”
In March, Sisenda Mvinjana, 24, appeared in the Pietermaritzburg High Court and pleaded guilty to six counts of murder and one for attempted murder. 
“He was convicted accordingly and was sentenced to 30 years in prison for each murder and 10 years for the attempted murder.”
He was arrested at Ludidi in the Eastern Cape in February and was found in possession of a 9mm pistol suspected to be the same one used in killing the family members at Georgedale.
Police said in a statement on Thursday morning that a 25-year-old suspect had been arrested last week in Mpumalanga. 
“He is appearing (on Thursday) in the Mpumalanga Magistrates Court on six counts of murder and attempted murder.”
