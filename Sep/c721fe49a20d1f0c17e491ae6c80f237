Maqaqa and two other councillors were shot in July in Umzimkhulu. Maqaqa died in hospital this month and no suspects have yet been arrested for the shooting. The two councillors survived the shooting.
Speaking to The Mercury on the sidelines of Police Minister Fikile Mbalula's visit to Magaqa's family home in Ibisi, Umzimkhulu, a crestfallen Noluthando Dlamini, 25. says Magaqa's death has dealt the family a huge blow, one they will never recover from.

"When news of his death came through we were so devastated that we were even scared to walk on the streets because we thought we were also being followed," says Dlamini. 
She described Magaqa as a  principled man who never shied away from telling the truth. 
"He liked to see things being done according to plan and in line with the budget set, he was outspoken like most politicians are and he could defend his stance well," Dlamini says.

Whether Magaqa's principled stance may have led to his killing, Dlamini said it remained a mystery to the family. 
"I will always remember my uncle as a sweet person and with him around we never wanted for anything, growing up even on our birthdays he would go out of his way to ensure he made us happy," says Dlamini. 
With Magaqa having been on the mend when he died, Dlamini said they had been looking to having him back home.
