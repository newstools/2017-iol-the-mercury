Durban - Former KwaZulu-Natal premier Senzo Mchunu has expressed concerns about his safety, saying his fears were based on the political instability within the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal.Mchunu, who has been seen as the chief lobbyist for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC presidential campaign, said the situation within the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal was of grave concern for him and all members of the party.But ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli accused Mchunu of exaggerating the situation. “His exaggeration is driven by factionalism. There is no credible evidence which links the PEC to the political murders in the province. He is a man who is desperate for headlines,” said Ntuli. In a telephonic interview yesterday, Mchunu said the fear for his life had made it difficult for him to reveal where and when he would be addressing gatherings.   “It would be nice for my activities to appear in the paper, but security wise it is not advisable.“The situation is unstable. The ANC is unstable at the moment, and it has an impact on the security arrangements of all members of the ANC,” he said.Although he did not elaborate on the volatility of the situation, Mchunu said he, through his experience, had been able to see the signs that he required to take the necessary precautions.“I always make sure not to confirm anything,” he said.
