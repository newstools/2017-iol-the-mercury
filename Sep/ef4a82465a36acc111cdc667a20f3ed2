Spokesperson for the security company, Kyle van Reenen, said members of its special operations team, along with metro police, responded and drove to the location where a white Toyota Hilux was found abandoned. 

“The vehicle had sustained severe strip damage from suspects attempting to locate the vehicle’s satellite tracking device. Although the number plates had been changed to false plates, a search on the vehicle’s VIN revealed that it had been stolen earlier in the evening from the Umhlanga Ridge area,” said Van Reenen.

He said further investigation revealed that the owner, a foreigner visiting from Lesotho, had parked the vehicle on returning to his temporary residence where it had been stolen. 

Van Reenen said the suspects had fled before the arrival of authorities and were still at large.
