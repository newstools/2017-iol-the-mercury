The 60 sheep being kept on a Morningside residential property before their sacrifice in the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha have been removed.The sighting of the sheep, in 7th Avenue, is the third such case in Durban in a week.The Mercury reported on Tuesday that around 67 sheep and goats were being kept in a plush Westville neighbourhood.On Monday, The Mercury carried a report saying that 100 sheep and goats worth R250 000 were being housed at a luxury property in Morningside.They have also since been removed.In all three instances, neighbours and ward councillors alerted the city and complained about the smell and noise coming from the animals.The animals were being kept on the property until they could be sold to worshippers before today’s prayer.One of the people selling the animals at 7th Avenue – who wished to remain anonymous – said they had been brought closer to the city so that indigent families could afford to partake in the religious observance.The animals were being sold for between R1 450 and R2 800 each.“Some people don’t have bakkies and the trip to the farm can be very expensive. Some people want to do it, but simply can’t.”Most of the meat from the slaughter was distributed to poorer families, he said.“I am very disappointed because I try to be as tolerant and accommodating of everyone as I can.”He said the animals had been kept on the property for three days.“One of our neighbours told us that what we were doing was a form of animal cruelty because she was a vegetarian. Others told me that this was a white area so we couldn’t keep the sheep here.” eThekwini spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said in response to The Mercury’s queries that, to date, it had issued three contravention notices for the keeping of livestock on a residential property without a permit.“Regarding the premises on 7th Avenue, the owner has been given a verbal warning  to remove the sheep immediately. A follow-up inspection will be conducted to ensure compliance.”The council said that there were two by-laws that dealt with the keeping of  animals: the public health  and the city of Durban animal by-laws.The former specifically dealt with the keeping of animals and prohibited any person from using premises or any stable, kraal, shed, kennel,  sty or any other enclosure  for the keeping of bovines, horses, donkeys, goats,  sheep or pigs – except with the authority of the medical officer of health. The by-law also prohibits any animal being on any  street or public place except while being transported or in a vehicle.“If livestock is going to be kept on the premises for a period of time then a permit is required. If the livestock will be slaughtered for religious purposes, a ritual slaughter permit is then required.”Mthethwa said in cases where the by-laws were contravened, the city would issue a verbal warning.“If the verbal warning is not adhered to, a written notice could be served also with a time-bound period. “This might, in certain cases, be followed by a final notice. “Non-compliance would then generally result in legal action being implemented against the offending party.”“A ‘spot fine’ may also be issued if the circumstances so dictate; this would not necessitate the issuing of any prior warnings or notices.”
