It was not business as usual along Durban's Pixley ka Seme Street on Wednesday as thousands joined the Cosatu strike against state capture.
Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini led the strike with SACP national chairperson Senzeni Zokwana, Cosatu provincial leaders and leaders from affiliates and alliance partners.
Clad in red Cosatu T-shirts, those who marched, sang and danced as they slowly moved from King Dinuzulu Park to City Hall, were watched by scores of police officers.
A few shops remained open with guards standing at entrances but most shut their doors and waited for the crowds to move on.

Cosatu provincial secretary, Edwin Mkhize said they were satisfied with the turnout.
“This is an important day because we are raising issues at the heart of our struggle, the bread and butter issues of workers,” Mkhize said.
Songs in support of deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa dominated the march. Marchers let it be known that they were ready for Ramaphosa to lead.

The crowd took a swipe at president Jacob Zuma with a song that referred to the president’s relationship with the Guptas.
The trade union federation and the Communist Party said their intention was to voice their opposition to state capture, corruption and job losses, all issues that they blamed on Zuma’s government.
Placards called for the prosecution of those involved in state capture activities and for labour brokers to be scrapped.

Dlamini said the president should go beyond just investigating the Guptas in the proposed judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.
He said the turnout of the strike showed that Cosatu was alive and united.
“You cannot ignore Cosatu when we speak because we represent the workers of this country. Today we have dared the odds and are here to make our voices heard," he said.
An official from the KZN provincial government received the memorandum from Cosatu on behalf of premier Willies Mchunu.
