Durban - Two men, believed to bodyguards attached to the secretary of the ANC in eThekwini region, Bheki Ntuli, have been caught on video brandishing guns including what is believed to be an AK47. In the video, laden with expletives, the men could be heard threatening to “kill the dog”. It is not clear to whom they were referring. The ANC in KZN issued a statement on Thursday condemning the video which it labelled as “disturbing”.

 “The ANC strongly denounces and distances itself from this irresponsible display of weapons, irrespective of the purpose for which it was done. We call on the security company responsible for these security guards to take actions against this unpalatable conduct,” said ANC KZN spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli. In the statement the ANC refers to the men as the regional secretary’s security guards. The DA said the ANC should explain why the bodyguards have “an illegal firearm” DA MP Dean McPherson said the date on which the video was filmed should also be established “in case it can be linked it to previous killings that have taken place”. “Could this video be the ‘smoking gun’ that will finally link ANC officials to politically motivated killings in KwaZulu-Natal?” he asked. Bheki Ntuli could not be immediately reached for comment. Violence monitor Vanessa Burger said Ntuli should be asked where his bodyguards get their guns from. The ANC in eThekwini region said it was “shocked and traumatised” by this video.  “In a province where we are battling an upsurge in political killings, such behaviour and conduct is despicable and any right thinking person should condemn such naked display of violence,” spokesperson Zinhle Cele said.The region said it would study the contents of the video and “if proven to be true and authentic, strong action must be taken”.Cele said “security arrangements are privately sourced and security personnel belong to the company assigned the responsibility”.  “It is also impossible for the Regional Secretary or any other leader for that matter to know the conduct and actions of the security or any other personnel that happen in his or her absence. In this regard there will be strong engagements with the company that is the employer of the security personnel implicated in this incident”.The Mercury
