“Reports from the scene allege that the victim was swimming in the lagoon with two other boys when the incident occurred.
The two boys called for help when they noticed their friend was in trouble.” 
Dollman said bystanders and lifeguards entered the water and pulled the child to the shore. 
“They initiated CPR and called for further assistance.
Paramedics from Netcare 911 and other private ambulance services responded to the incident and took over the resuscitation effort.”
The boy, he said, had been placed on a ventilator and medication administered as per resuscitation protocols. 
“CPR was continued for the prescribed time period. Tragically, however, despite the efforts of the paramedics and first responders, the boy succumbed and was declared dead at the scene.”
He said police and their Search and Rescue unit were also at the scene and initiated their investigation into the incident.
