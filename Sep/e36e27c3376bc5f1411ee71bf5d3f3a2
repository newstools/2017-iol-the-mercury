Marshall Security said in a statement that they had been called to the scene of a house robbery which had occurred at a residence in Preston Drive, Prestondale on Thursday morning.
The service’s spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said reports from the scene indicated that three men, armed with knives, forced entry into the home by removing the burglar guards and entering through a bathroom window.
“A mom and daughter who were home at the time, were confronted by the suspects, who cable tied their hands behind their backs and confined them to a bedroom. 
The armed men then ransacked the premises before stealing the homeowner’s vehicle, a white Volkswagen Polo, and fleeing in an unknown direction.”
He said further investigation revealed that the vehicle had been fitted with a satellite tracking device. 
“A signal was found in the Blackburn Village area and the (service’s) operations team descended on the area, where the vehicle was found abandoned on a river bank.”
The suspects have not yet been arrested.
