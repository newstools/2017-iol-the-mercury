For weeks, angry parents have been blockading the gates to prevent the newly appointed principal, Sharon Ndlovu, from assuming duties at Assegai Primary School.
These parents, backed by the school governing body (SGB), claim that Ndlovuâ€™s appointment was not above board as some processes were flawed.

Instead, they want another candidate, a teacher at the school, to be appointed.
The Department of Education ended up approaching the court to bring an end to the unrest at the school.
On Wednesday, Acting Judge Feisal Abraham said he was "not at all impressed" with the situation.
"We are coming to the end of the year and these children are locked out of school," he said.
He granted an interim interdict, by consent, and the matter will be back in court next month.
