Senior Durban academic, veterinarian and stalwart public servant Professor Anis Karodia will take up the post of acting chief executive of the Isimangaliso Wetland Park Authority with almost immediate effect. Karodia, a senior academic and researcher at the Regent School of Business, said he was “humbled” to accept a six-month contract to head Isimangaliso following the exit of veteran conservationist Andrew Zaloumis.Zaloumis, who served at the helm for 20 years, has departed to pursue studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK.Department of Environmental Affairs spokesperson Albie Modise confirmed yesterday that Karodia will report for duty on September 11 to take over from interim chief executive Terri Castis. Karodia, 66, who has numerous degrees and qualifications in business, management, philosophy, veterinary science and public health, worked on the development of the Pilanesberg National Park and Game Reserve in North West under leading conservationist and eco-tourism planner Roger Collinson. He said he believed he had been appointed because of his veterinary experience and his “mammoth experience in public management”.“I think it will be an easy environment to fit into, provided people are doing their work. It will be business as usual,” Karodia said.He has previously served as chief director and acting HoD in the department of agriculture in North West, as superintendent-general in the North West Department of Education, and as chief administrator of education in the Limpopo Department  of Education, among other positions. He served on the board of the Agricultural Research Council for three years and for 10 years as a board member of the SA Veterinary Council.Isimangaliso Wetland Park Authority board chairman Buyani Zwane said Karodia had been selected because of his vast experience.Zaloumis said last night that the board, management, staff and future chief executives would have his continued support on request.
