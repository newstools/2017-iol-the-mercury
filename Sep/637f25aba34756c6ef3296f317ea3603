The "Z" in Zodwa Wabantu's name might just stand for "zero flips given", after the controversial dancer went skinny dipping in what seems to be a resort or hotel pool.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Zodwa shared her "naked truth" video with her Instagram fans, encouraging them to not be too concerned about what people have to say say. She wrote: "Freedom is knowing kuyafana (all the same) Do you. Don't suffer from bazothini abantu (what will people say) Naked pool. Naked truth. Zodwa Wabantu".

Zodwa has made quite a few headlines in recent months after she said she wanted to be stripper and was banned from performing at Zimbabwe's Harare International Carnival in held earlier this month.

At the time, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe told a crowd of thousands in Bindura that he knew he was  "disappointing many men" for banning Zodwa from performing at the event.

The Zimbabwean president lambasted Zodwa, who is famous for her sultry moves and revealing clothes, for attending parties without wearing underwear.

He said: "I'm sorry we disappointed many men... You just come without covering your decency. What do you want? Men to see you? We don't want such..."

It would seem that Zodwa is living by her motto: "don't suffer from bazothini abantu."
