Nokuthula Dladla, owner of Megaphase Road Marking & Traffic Signs in Durban North lives by the philosophy “your past should never determine your future”.The company, a long-cherished dream for Dladla, specialises in the manufacture of road signs and road surface marking and has an extensive clientele in KwaZulu-Natal.Dladla, 59, who has two children and is married to Walter Dladla, said the biggest challenge she encountered in establishing her business was to be taken seriously in a male-dominated industry.“I have years of experience in this sector and know the business extensively. However, I sometimes get sidelined for business opportunities simply because I am a woman,” Dladla said.She is the sole owner of her company which she founded in 2009 with just eight staff, and today employs 81 people. Dladla is one of three special awards recipients in Ithala’s 2017 Business Achiever Awards. She bagged the award for Operational Excellence in the Manufacturing Sector.Before discovering her entrepreneurial flair and opening the manufacturing business, Dladla worked as a sales woman for Nedbank for several years, until one of her bank clients spotted her potential and snapped her up to manage his business, which specialised in signs. Dladla eventually decided to step out on her own and opened her own small road sign manufacturing firm.She obtained financial advice from the Ithala Development Finance Corporation at the Durban SMME Fair and within three weeks she managed to secure a loan.“I was desperate and needed money to purchase a factory for my business. I needed to grow my business and be taken seriously as a woman in an industry which has a strong male representation,” she said.Dladla said one of the highlights of her success has been that she has been able to employ young people who do not have a formal education and others who don’t have the means to further their studies.She said her own difficult upbringing, which she was reluctant to divulge, had compelled her to lend a hand to others who have experienced hardships by offering them an opportunity to lead a dignified life.Her success story has inspired her children to start a similar business on a small scale which they co-own and run in Gauteng.Dladla sold the signage manufacturing division of the company in July  – she still runs the road marking division – to empower  four employees, who she recruited five years ago. As part of the take-over agreement she will continue to mentor them for the next three years.“Looking back, I don’t think anyone would have had confidence that I would amount to anything because of my circumstances. “However, I always had a vision for myself and knew deep down that my determination would be the reason for my success one day,” Dladla said.She said her only wish now  was for more opportunities to be  created for youngsters to get on the entrepreneurial ladder so they  can employ their skills to  contribute to the economy.
