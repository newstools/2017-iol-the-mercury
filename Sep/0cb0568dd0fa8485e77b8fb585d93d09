"This afternoon an 18-year-old man was shot and killed in Erie Court, Hanover Park by a suspect who fled the scene. Police reacted and in the process a suspect was arrested who was sought for another murder which was also perpetrated in Hanover Park," Traut said. 
The community attacked the police and in the process two of our members were injured, he said. 
Traut said the matter is under investigation. 
Social media posts claimed police officers were shot but this was debunked by police. 
Mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith confirmed through information gathered from ShotSpotter that there was a shooting in the area. 
ShotSpotter detects and conveys the location of gunfire or other weapon fire using acoustic, optical or other types of sensors.
