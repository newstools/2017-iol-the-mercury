Pietermaritzburg - A woman has been left in a serious condition after being attacked by two dogs in Pietermaritzburg.
 
ER24’s Russel Meiring said paramedics were driving past, when they were flagged down by a member of the public.
 
They were taken to a 35-year-old woman, sitting on a bench, being treated by first aiders.
 
“The woman was assessed and found to have sustained numerous bite wounds to her legs, arms, neck and head, leaving her in a serious condition,” Meiring said. “Paramedics treated the woman for her injuries and provided her with pain-relief medication … Once treated, the woman was transported to a nearby hospital for urgent treatment.”
 
While paramedics were treating the woman, a man was allegedly attacked by the same dogs. The man was transported privately to a nearby hospital.
 
It is understood that the dogs had attacked someone else and that the man, stepped in to try to assist.
 
Meiring said the SPCA was on scene to capture the animals.
 
Their breed was not known.
