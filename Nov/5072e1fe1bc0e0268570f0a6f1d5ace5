DURBAN - Grace Mugabe, former First Lady of Zimbabwe is reported to have pleaded with President Emmerson Mnangagwa's new administration to continue with the building of the $1 billion Robert Gabriel Mugabe University. This request may not be top priority for Mnangagwa's government. Upon his return to Harare, Zimbabwe's President designate Emmerson Mnangagwa announced that his focus was to grow the countries fledgling economy,  "we want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs," he said. The current administration, under the President designate's rule, need to drastically turn the Zimbabwean economy  around whilst garnering support from the people of Zimbabwe.The economic output of Zimbabwe was cut in half during the period of 1997 to 2008, and has not regained its position since. Around 80% of Zimbabweans contribute to the country's informal economy. Social and economic resilience has been weakened by mismanagement.Despite this, Grace is intent on protecting the legacy of her husband, Robert Mugabe. The former first lady has also pleaded for the streets and structures named after Robert Mugabe not to be renamed. Grace has also pleaded with mediators to ensure that the new government does not reverse the proposed grants for the university. The Robert Mugabe University project was proposed by the Minister of Higher Education, Professor Jonathan Moyo. The proposal was given the go ahead by cabinet in August 2017 and has been scheduled to be erected in Mazowe.The new government has not made any decisions on Grace's proposals however a source told the Sunday Times that it is too early to tell whether the Mnangagwa's government will agree to the former first lady's requests. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
