Two lionesses have been relocated to a KwaZulu-Natal game park in an effort to foster genetic diversity within the area.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
African Wildlife Vets – a conservation based non-profit organisation with the primary aim of assisting wildlife conservation organisations with the conservation of threatened species by providing essential supplementary veterinary support – said on their website that the animals had been transferred to the uMkhuze section of iSimangaliso Wetland Park from Makalali Private Game Reserve, Limpopo this month.
“Genetic diversity is one of the most important factors to consider when ensuring species are conserved. It is essential in small reserves where natural migration and emigration are not possible due to fences,” they said.

African Wildlife Vets managing director Kate Church explained that locating lions and being presented with a darting opportunity could take days without success. 
“A lion call-up involves dragging a carcass around an area where the lions are likely to be, then chaining it to a tree with some form of a barrier to prevent the lions from dragging the bait out of site and finally using an animal distress call with the hopes of luring the lion to the bait.”

The team said that it took no more than 30 minutes for the lion to respond to the calls and the smell of the bait. 
“Veterinarians Dr Ben Muller from Wildlife Vets and Dr Joel Alves were easily presented with a darting opportunity.” 
Before translocating any species, she said, it was important to ensure that they would not be transferring diseases to species in other areas.

For this reason, the vets tested the animals for tuberculosis (TB).
Once they were found to be TB-free, they were loaded into a crate for the final part of the operation: the journey to their new home.
After their arrival in the province, they will remain in the park’s boma for approximately four weeks to habituate them to their new environment.
Church said Ezemvelo KwaZulu Natal Wildlife staff, honorary officers and WILDLIFE ACT monitor PJ Roberts and volunteers had put great effort into ensuring that the uMkhuze bomas were ready for the lionesses’ arrival.
