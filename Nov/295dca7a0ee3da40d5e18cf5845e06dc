Netcare 911’s Nick Dollman told The Mercury that their emergency team and eThekwini Fire and Rescue had been called in after lift technicians had been unsuccessful in opening the lift doors.
The lift had become stuck between the 15th and 16th floors, and the emergency services received the call just before 9am.
He said after some time the lift was lowered to the fourth floor where the doors were finally opened by the lift technician.
Those inside the lift were then treated for dehydration. Six of them were transported to hospital for further care.
“It was alleged that they had been stuck in the lift for approximately two-and-a-half hours. Some of the occupants collapsed when they exited the lift.”
He said: “It was a very warm morning in the city which added to the discomfort of those who were stuck in the lift.”
