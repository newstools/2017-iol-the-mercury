Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said in a statement that three hijackers, two of them armed, had attempted to hijack a motorist of his vehicle as he waited outside a property to pick someone up at around 9.10pm.
“The motorist wrestled with the three hijackers who then turned and fled the scene towards Stamfordhill Road. They fired shots at a car guard who was standing nearby, injuring him in his leg, before jumping into a white Toyota Etios and fleeing the scene. A nearby security guard alerted us to the incident by pressing his panic button,” Mathios said.
‘Paramedics attended the scene of the crime and transported the injured car guard to a local hospital in a stable condition.”
Mathios said the suspects had robbed the motorist of his cellphone.
Durban Central SAPS attended the scene of the crime.
