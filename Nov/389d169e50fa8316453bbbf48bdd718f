This long-term project, which has been beset by delays, was finally unveiled in Abu Dhabi by French President Emmanuel Macron and crown prince Mohammed bin Zayad Al Nahyan.
Built over a decade, this new Louvre holds 600 artworks permanently and 300 loaned which have been loaned from France.

The project, which has also received its fair share of criticism - including allegations of the exploitation of migrant workers – was praised by critics. Its eye catching design boasts a signature latticed dome designed to allow the desert sun to filter through.

The BBC reported that the facility holds art and items related to history and religion from around the world and Macron called it a "bridge between civilisations".

He said: "Those who seek to say Islam is the destruction of other religions are liars".

The project, agreed to in 2007, was initially intended to open in 2012 but was delayed by the global financial crisis and plummeting oil prices.

Analysts have suggested this could be the start of further cultural development in Abu Dhabi, creating an arts, museum and cultural centre which could attract more of the world’s great museums and collections to take part.

The Guardian described it as “the first museum to be born out of a diplomatic agreement”.

The 30-year partnership is said to be worth $1.27bn (R18 billion), including $520m just for Abu Dhabi to use the Louvre name.
