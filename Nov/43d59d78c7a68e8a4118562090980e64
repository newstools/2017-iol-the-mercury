THE SANDF is prepared to go into South African towns and help fight crime – but the country must be prepared to take the consequences.“We’re not trained to fight crime, we’re trained to make war. We don’t take nonsense, if you point a gun at us, we mow you down,” General  Solly Shoke told journalists at his annual chief of the SANDF media briefing at Waterkloof Airforce Base outside Pretoria on Wednesday.Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has publicly appealed for the army to be deployed into crime ridden townships, in particular to help staunch gang warfare besetting Cape Town. Shoke refused to say whether the SANDF was preparing to be deployed, saying only: “We are soldiers, we take orders, we go anywhere the country needs us.”Shoke admitted the SANDF had experienced its fair share of difficulties this year. Finance and, more pertinently the lack of it, was a particular issue, especially since Parliament had passed the Defence Review in 2015, but had never provided the money for the SANDF to implement it.The budget had been shrinking each year, he said.“We are robbing Peter to pay Paul, but all the time more tasks are being given to the SANDF,” he said.A major stress on the budget is the age of combat soldiers, many of whom are now older than the international norm for the ranks and positions they hold.The other major issue vexing him and his generals is the level of discipline in the SANDF, which has been blighted by reports of soldiers being held up for their weapons, weapons being  sold to crime syndicates, some reserve unit officers and clerks demanding bribes to issue lucrative call ups to unemployed part-time soldiers.“Discipline is a must,” Shoke said. “The amendment of the Military Discipline Act is before Parliament because we feel military judges and commanders need to be empowered to impose heavy sanctions for disciplinary breaches.“There is no in between. Under our command we have weapons of war, we’re the only institution entrusted with the security of the country. “People who are ill-disciplined don’t belong here. We do dismiss them but then some of them go to court and interdict us, which doesn’t gel well.”The Military Police, he said, had done a sterling job in bringing perpetrators to book.
