On Tuesday on Oakford Road near Osindisweni Hospital, at approximately 9.53am, members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were dispatched to the scene after receiving a tip-off from a passerby, who said the trailer had been abandoned on the roadside.
"After investigation it was established that the stolen goods belonged to Chester Meats and were worth R400 000. It is alleged that the contents of the shipping container had been imported from Brazil and were stolen from Durban on Monday." 
RUSA said the contents of the container were generally used to manufacture processed chicken products such as polony, sausages and burgers. 
"It is believed that the suspects had stolen the wrong trailer and intended to steal one containing dressed poultry."
The recovered goods, they said, were suspected of being contaminated due to it not being refrigerated overnight.
