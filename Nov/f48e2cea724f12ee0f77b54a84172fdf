Durban - An eManzimtoti couple not only had to deal with a home invasion and robbery this past weekend, but the robbers then proceeded to take meat out the freezer and cook themselves a meal.Blue Security reported that the home invasion occurred late on Friday evening when robbers broke into the Burne Road home at about 10.45pm.Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the couple was sitting in the lounge when a gang of four suspects forced open the kitchen door and stormed into the house.“The gang tied up the couple and proceeded to ransack the property in search of valuables. They grabbed a safe, firearms, televisions, jewellery, cellphones, wine and a wallet containing cash which they loaded into their getaway vehicle,” Mathios said.Incredibly, the couple reported that the suspects then took meat out of their freezer, cooked it and ate the meal before fleeing the scene.Mathios said the couple was unharmed and declined crisis counselling.eManzimtoti SAPS attended the scene of the crime.The Mercury
