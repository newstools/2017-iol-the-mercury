Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said in response to The Mercury’s queries that on November 18, 2017 at approximately 2.20am, a local security company had been on duty when they noticed an unfamiliar vehicle at one of the farms in Paddock. 
“They approached the vehicle and four (men) came out from the bush. The security guards asked them to open the car and found one dead buck in the boot and five licensed firearms.”
The South Coast Herald reported this week that three 9mm pistols, a .223 semi-automatic assault rifle and a .22 rifle – both with silencers – and three magazines were also found. The .223 assault rifle was also equipped with night vision. 
The security guards told the poachers that they were under arrest for illegal poaching and Paddock police were contacted. The suspects were handed over to them. 
“The firearms were also seized by the police. The men appeared at Ezinqoleni Court on November 20, 2017 where they were released on free bail until January 6, 2018.”
