The school, said in a statement that, it had been recognised for its excellence in the two subjects based on their 2016 Grade 12 final examinations.
It was ranked in the top 16 best-performing schools in South Africa, out of all the independent and state schools in the country.
Kearsney headmaster Elwyn van den Aardweg said: “The school’s emphasis on mathematics and science excellence had impacted on other subjects too, with outstanding results coming through in the arts and humanities.” 
This was the sixth year that the school had achieved almost double the Independent Examination Board’s (IEB) average.
In 2016, 49.4% of the boys who wrote mathematics attained distinctions (compared with the national average of 27% across all IEB schools) and 47.5% in physical science (compared to 19% in IEB schools). 
Eight of the country’s top physical science achievers last year were from the school.
