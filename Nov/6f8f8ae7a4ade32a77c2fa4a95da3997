KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport Community Safety and Liaison Mxolisi Kaunda has told police “not to die with their guns in their gun holsters at the hands of merciless criminals”.

Kaunda was addressing members of the security cluster units gathered at the Westville prison on Wednesday where he was to present a comprehensive safety plan for the festive season. 

The details of the plan were however not revealed publicly, and Kaunda said the meeting was aimed at ensuring co-ordination within law enforcement agencies.

He urged the police, that in their fight against well-armed criminals, they should not allow themselves to be victims.

“When you are faced with criminals carrying AK47s, my appeal to you is that you protect the constitution of the country and defend yourselves. If they are shooting at you, remember you are not carrying toy guns here to squirt out water."

He said: “When you are under fire, you must return fire with fire. As the police, you must die with your guns in your hands.”

Kaunda has previously told police to act without restraint when facing hardened criminal. Former police commissioner Bheki Cele, while still leading the police force, uttered the same and his remarks were largely blamed for the spate of police shootings that followed.
