Residents of informal settlement Dakota in Isipingo held a march to create awareness around the abuse of women and children in the area on Wednesday.
The local government clinic in the area in co-operation with Project Empower hosted a high tea where women were educated on issues affecting women, ranging from cancers that women are susceptible to, physical and emotional abuse and the link between gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS.
Gender activist Ntokozo Madlala from Project Empower said creating awareness around issues of abuse should not be seen as a campaign to diminish the role of men in communities.

“We need to educate our men and women on constructive ways of voicing out their frustrations, without resorting to abuse or violence.”
Addressing the community, Project Empower's Sibongile Madlala said: “Today is about HIV prevention and gender based violence, we’ve found that there is link between the two. And, especially in an area of this kind, violence against women is quite prevalent, which is why we started working within this community.”

“We hosted this high tea, to try and get the women in this area to come in their numbers to attend.  (An event like this) is something most of them have never been to but it is also a chance for them to speak out about any form of abuse they deal with in their homes.
It’s important to give them an outlet so that they don’t take out their frustrations on their children or harm themselves,” she said.
