Durban North and Umhlanga Rocks were rocked by two house robberies occurring within an hour of each other on Wednesday afternoon. In the first incident, seven armed suspects forced entry into a home in Westridge Road in Umhlanga Rocks, said Marshall Security spokesman Kyle van Reenen. He said the woman home owner - who was home at the time - was held up at gunpoint while the men ransacked her home, making off with jewellery and a safe containing undisclosed items. They made their getaway in a vehicle that was standing by. About 45 minutes later, at 2.15pm, seven armed suspects derailed a driveway gate to a home in Kenneth Kaunda (Northway) Road, before getting into the home by breaking through a security door and gate with a crowbar. The home owner's children, who were home at the time, stayed in a bedroom while the armed men ransacked the home, making off with undisclosed items. “Before the suspects could flee the scene, the home owner returned home. Noticing his driveway gate was open, the man suspected the worst and was confronted by an armed suspect. The home owner and his daughter, who was in the vehicle with him at the time, got out and ran away to safety, while the suspects fled the home towards Blackburn Road.” Van Reenen said a neighbour, who witnessed the incident, gave chase, pursuing the vehicle to the intersection of Kenneth Kaunda and Swapo Roads (Broadway), where the suspects fired a shot at him. The vehicle then fled towards Chris Hani Road (North Coast Road). There were no injuries sustained in either incident, however the victims were traumatised and the assistance of the Durban North Umhlanga Crisis Team was sought to counsel them. The SAPS were investigating both incidents.
