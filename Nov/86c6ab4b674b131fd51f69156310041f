Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal family has won a Lotto Plus jackpot of almost R28 million, after years of playing and praying together for a big win. The member of the family, whose name was on the ticket, said they were a big and close-knit family and had decided together to appoint him to claim the R27 789 331.50 Lotto Plus draw from October 25. “For years we have played the Lotto as a family unit, by each giving our parents money and numbers for them to play,” he said. “It is only natural that we are all winners and we all share the jackpot.” The winnings will be deposited into his bank account, then the family will transfer each member their share.  “We played a combined R4000 and our parents called us over to tell us they checked the Lotto Plus ticket and we won the jackpot. We they prayed together as a family because for us winning was a blessing from God,” said the man. A careful spender, he said with his portion, he plans on continuing to work, completing his postgraduate qualification, pay off his debts and will invest the rest.  “My biggest joy is that my children will be able to attend the best schools in South Africa and now they can start saving towards their tertiary education. I know my sister is already looking at enrolling her kids into a private school - this is what the Lotto Plus jackpot has made possible,” he said. They are also planning their first international holiday together as a family. “My passport is about to expire and I have never used it,” he said.The Mercury
