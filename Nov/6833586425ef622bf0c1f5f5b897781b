Public Protecter Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report states that the decision to “relax” bylaws was unlawful and a violation of national legislation. The Ray Nkonyeni municipality had also breached its own anti-nudity policies.
The KwaZulu-Natal Naturist Association told The Mercury it was already set to counter her ruling, and aimed to re-apply for the status.
Speaking to the Mercury on Thursday, the association’s chairperson, Chris Elliot, said they had just received the report.

The Concerned Citizens Group (CCG) had opposed the nudist beach from inception. The group’s Mike Effanga accused the municipality of having “colluded” with the nudists.
