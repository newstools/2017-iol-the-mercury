Criminal charges against Ugu District Municipality workers and their union are expected to be laid next month by residents on the South Coast. Organiser Sam Botha said they were in the process of appointing an advocate and were speaking to one who experienced the water woes first-hand. Botha said they were looking to press criminal charges against the South African Municipal Workers Union and workers for alleged sabotage and vandalism of water services and infrastructure. Botha said they planned to file the submission for the criminal charges in December, while a civil suit against the municipality would follow early next year.
