After a tough year hitting their books, matric pupils will be making their way to The Rage Festival in Umhlanga and Ballito from this weekend.The event – held across multiple venues, with hundreds of hours of live music, international and local artists, world-class production, enhanced safety and security, its own transport system, and art installations – spans several days between Saturday and December 9.Organisers said in a statement that every year the festival worked hard to boost security and safety measures for “Ragers”.“The festival boasts an excellent track record. These measures include working with both the local police services and private security who operate openly and in plain clothes to monitor the festival across multiple venues. A comprehensive safety team is employed that includes medics, The Red Frogs and is led by event-technology platform, Howler.”The platform works by issuing each person an armband that acts as a virtual wallet for cashless transactions and also as an information source in the event of an emergency. “(We) want to give parents peace of mind that their children are in safe hands. If something goes wrong, they will know immediately, as all personal details and emergency contact information is loaded onto the armband," said the organisers.The festival will also host music extravaganza The Sound Factory, which includes four stages and international and local artists such as Brynny, Teddy Cream, Sevenn, Stimming, Township Rebellion, Vini Vici, Cat Dealers, Stephan Bodzin, Nasty C, Pop Art Live and Black Coffee.The concerts will take place on Saturday, December 4, 6 and 8.
