The woman had been in a VW Polo that crashed into into a truck and a traffic light at the Canelands and R102  intersection.
Reaction Unit South Africa said their officers arrived at the scene around 8.30am and found that a white VW Polo had collided with a truck and traffic light. The traffic light was knocked down in the incident.
RUSA said both the driver and passenger in the Polo were treated for minor injuries on the scene and the driver was taken to hospital. However the woman refused medical treatment and requested that Reaction Officers assist her to get to the airport so that she would not miss her flight.
The woman, reportedly told RUSA officers, that she was in South Africa to complete her Psychology Studies and that she had been enroute to King Shaka International Airport to board a flight back to Oslo.
