A launch event was held on Friday at Princess Magogo Stadium, KwaMashu, after which police headed to KwaMashu Men’s Hostel to conduct crime prevention operations. A 50-year-old suspect was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. A total of 10 suspects were arrested for various crimes in the area.
According to SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, from November 2 to 4 SAPS arrested a total of 807 suspects, for crimes ranging from murder, rape, possession of drugs, to armed robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition and possession of counterfeit goods.
eMlazi SAPS spotted a red Mini Cooper driving along Arbor Road, eManzimtoti, fitted with two different number plates. Gwala said when police approached the vehicle, the suspects opened fire after which the police retaliated.
The police arrested the culprits and no injuries were reported. Police recovered a 9mm pistol with 14 rounds of ammunition, housebreaking tools, three cellphones and other exhibits. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the vehicle had been stolen in Pietermaritzburg in 2014. Two suspects aged 27 and 38 will appear in the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court on Monday on various charges.
KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, said: “The results of the operations conducted over these three days prove that the SAPS and our partners in the province are committed towards combatting all forms of crimes in the KZN. These operations will continue to make sure that all the criminals who terrorise our community are locked behind bars where they belong.”
