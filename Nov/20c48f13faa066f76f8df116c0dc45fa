Durban - Lawrence Dube and his fellow applicants say they will return with confidence to the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday to hear whether their application for leave to execute judgment of a previous order was successful.Dube and others, unofficially known as the rebels, brought an application for leave to execute judgment pending any appeal. If they are granted their application, it would mean that the original September court order to dissolve the KZN Provincial Executive Committee would take effect, until the appeal by that committee was heard and concluded.Dube was the main applicant in the High Court case against the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal who walked away victorious when they challenged the results of the ANC's 2015 provincial elective conference, which saw Sihle Zikalala replace former premier Senzo Mchunu as the provincial chairperson.The judgment effectively disbanded the leadership structure led by provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala.The Provincial Executive Committee appealed the judgment before the National Executive Committee could make a decision on the prospects of an appeal.“Victory has already set in for us and I doubt we will be in court for too long,” said a confident Dube.It seems that Thursday’s appearance will not see hundreds of supporters outside court as has been the case in previous court appearances.Now read: ANC PEC decides to appealBoth Dube and ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said they did not plan on asking supporters to accompany them to court.“At this time everyone is busy with the elective conference and we want them to concentrate on that. It will be a quick visit to the court so it is okay that everyone concentrates on the conference,” Dube said.Ntuli said he would also be at the High Court and the ANC leadership did not invite anyone “except a few of us who are permitted inside the courtroom”.The Mercury
