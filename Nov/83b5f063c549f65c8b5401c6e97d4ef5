However, the public is urged to not stockpile water as it will put the reservoir system under strain. If there is a demand on the reservoir system it will lead to the reservoirs being drained and residents being without water. The public is therefore urged to use water conservatively."The following areas will be affected during the course of the 26-hour-period:PrestburyNorthdaleRaisethorpeWoodlandsMasonsBisleyAshdownCaluzaWillowfontainUnit HSinathingAzaleaUnit 18FoxhillAshburtonThe Mercury
