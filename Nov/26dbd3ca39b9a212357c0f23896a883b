A Durban hospital is being investigated after a video – showing a nurse allegedly abusing a patient – was widely shared on social media.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health said in statement on Wednesday that they “strongly condemned” the alleged conduct of a staff nurse from St Mary’s Hospital, which if true, would be in violation of the code of conduct of health care professionals. 
“The alleged incident, which took place on November 6, 2017, was captured on video and widely distributed on social media.”

The video had been circulated via social media networks, prompting the Department of Health to launch an investigation.

In the video, they said, the nurse appears to be addressing the patient in a manner “that did not convey empathy”. 
“The nurse also appears to be changing the patient’s nappy without drawing the bedside curtains to maintain the privacy of the patient. Such conduct is contrary to the Batho Pele principles and Codes Governing Health Care Professionals.”
They said the management of the hospital was dealing with this matter according to the Department of Health’s disciplinary procedures.
The patient, according to some social media users, has since died, but this could not be confirmed.
