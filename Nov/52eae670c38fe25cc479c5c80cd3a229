A 33-year-old man has been found guilty on charges of murder at the Ngwelezane Regional Court.
Khayelihle Ntombela had been accused of killing his grandmother, Bonakele Ntombela, 82, at Othini Area, Ntambanana.Â 
The murder took place on August 17, 2017 at the Ntombela homestead.
Police said that it was alleged that when Ntombela arrived home around 2pm on the day, he asked for food and, as the deceased was preparing the meal for him, he attacked her with a knife, stabbing her on the head and body.
He proceeded to beat her up with a knobkerrie. The elderly woman was fatally wounded and died on the scene.
A case of murder was opened at Ntambanana Police Station and the case was further investigated by the Ntambanana detectives.
The man was arrested on the same day. He made several court appearances at Ngwelezane Regional Court; he was refused bail until his conviction.
Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa said: "This case was finalised within three months after the crime was committed. The accused showed no mercy and brutally attacked an elderly woman who took care of him. He deserves no place in our society. His rightful place is in jail."
