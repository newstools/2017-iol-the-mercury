According to Abahlali Basemjondolo spokesperson, Thapelo Mohapi, the  man is from Mozambique and will need to repatriated to his country of birth.
It is suspected that a candle toppled over and caused the fire, and the fire spread at a rapid rate throughout the informal settlement.
Fire-fighters arrived on scene but were delayed by the community from putting out the fire when frustrated residents cut the water hose, in a bid to get water to douse their burning shacks; this decreased the water pressure, further delaying the fire-fighters.

A mob of residents then turned on the fire-fighters, injuring one of the fire-fighters with a pipe. Fire-fighters were only able to return to the scene under police-guard.
A resident at the informal settlement condemned this behaviour, saying that it was not how shack dwellers conducted themselves.
Abahlali Basemjondolo spokesperson, Thapelo Mohapi said: “We will work to rebuild the community and to organise to fight future fires together and to work with the fire department.”
