Pretoria - Duncan Prinsloo has challenged EFF leader Julius Malema to shoot him to see 'if he is a man'. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“I want to challenge Malema, who is the big instigator of farm murders. I will give him a rifle, load it and I will stand still so he could finish what they began. And I want to see if he is a man because he can shout out to the youngsters and them to go murder farmers at their farms, so I want to give him a weapon where he can come and shoot where everybody can see so he can show whether he is a man or a mouse,” he said.

Prinsloo said this during the march against farm murders and attacks. The 70-year-old from Bronkhorstspruit said he and his wife were attacked at their farm in 2008. He was shot in the back but his wife was killed.

The group wanted the fulfilment of the promise that an alternative to the commando system would be instituted in a way to empower farmers to look after their own safety more efficiently, with the financial backing from the government.Democratic Alliance, Congress of the People (COPE), Freedom Front Plus, Solidarity and Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU SA) all took part in the march.
