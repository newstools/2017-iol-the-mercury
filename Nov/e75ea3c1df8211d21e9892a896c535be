The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), has appointed assessment doctors in KwaZulu-Natal.
The province has for the past two months been without these medical specialists, said SASSA in a statement.
The doctors' contracts expired on September 2017 and new contracts were scheduled to be implemented October 1, 2017.

These appointments were put on hold when SASSA received instruction from the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) to stop the appointment of doctors contracted to the Department of Health, since this was seen to be in breach of the Public Service Act and the Public Service Regulations of 2016, which prohibits government officials from conducting business with other government entities.

SASSA has since been inundated with calls from beneficiaries who were worried about the delays in the rescheduling of their assessment dates. With some not able to go for re-assessments, they could not renew their SASSA grants and have money to buy necessities.
After successful discussions between SASSA and DPSA, Assessments Doctors are expected to commence with their duties during the first week of December 2017.
SASSA Acting Regional Executive Manager KZN, Sbusiso Nhlangothi said: “We regret any adverse effect this might have caused to our beneficiaries. We have formulated a backlog management strategy that will focus on offices with the highest backlog figures.”
