Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has congratulated the provincial task team deployed in northern KwaZulu-Natal for recently arresting six dangerous criminals. 

On Tuesday, the team made a breakthrough after receiving a tip-off from community members, and arrested six alleged hitmen who had been operating between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. 
These dangerous criminals, said the minister in a statement, had been linked to taxi-related incidents, police killings, ATM bombings, cash-in-transit heists, armed robbery and hijackings.

“We have always believed that our people remain in the centre in fighting crime and criminality. I must thank community members for working with the police and gave valuable information that led to arrest of dangerous criminals,” Minister Mbalula said.

The team consisted of the Tactical Response Team, National Intervention Unit, and Public Order Policing and was assembled after five people were fatally wounded about a week ago.

These criminals were found in possession of seven unlicensed firearms, and a lot of ammunition. They were arrested just outside of Richards Bay.

“I congratulate the police for a job well done. Our people deserve peace and we are tasked by the constitution of our country to serve and protect all people within the territory of the Republic of South Africa. This must serve as a clear warning to all criminals that the South African Police Service are on duty. Police will ensure that our people enjoy festive season in peace,” Mbalula added.
