Durban - The family of the ­Ladysmith taxi boss killed in an ambush on Tuesday morning that left 11 people dead - including six teachers - said it would have been better if he had been the only person killed in the shooting.The driver of Muzikayifani Ngobese, 64, the Deputy Chairperson of the Klipriver Taxi Association, lost control of their bakkie during the ambush and it collided with a taxi, killing six teachers.Four other people travelling with Ngobese, his daughter, driver and two bodyguards, were also killed. It is alleged that Ngobese’s ambush is related to a dispute over taxi routes.Family spokesperson Joyce Ngobese, said they were saddened that so many people had been killed.“We had expected that he might be attacked, he was getting threats via SMS, and had been shot in September but survived. What is saddening is that innocent people have been killed.”  Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana visited Ladysmith on Wednesday so the department could see for itself what the situation was.  “ We went there to speak to the affected teachers and learners and give them support as well as offer our condolences to the families of the deceased.“The situation was very tense,” the MEC said. “The teachers and learners were crying. It was devastating to see them in such a state”.Attempts to get comment from the Transport and Community Safety Department were unsuccessful on Wednesday.The Mercury
