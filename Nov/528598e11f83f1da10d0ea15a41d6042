A "poo throwing" incident has marred an address scheduled to be delivered by former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan in KwaDukuza on Sunday. Gordhan was scheduled to speak at the Stanger Siva Sungum hall when two men allegedly from the local ANCYL dumped two buckets filled with faeces at the entrance but, following the discovery of the faeces, had to be whisked away from the hall in KwaDukuza as league members allegedly hurled objects at the building.The secretary of an ANCYL branch in KwaDukuza, referred to as '"Monkeytown" informal settlement, said they had organised 10 minibus taxis to bring supporters to disrupt the event.Lucky Mbokazi said their members had dumped the faeces as a sign of protest against business people who are blocking the building of a mall in KwaDukuza and not specifically aimed at the former finance minister. Gordhan was invited by the Concerned Citizens Group to be a guest speaker at the fundraising event.
