Former Minister Pravin Gordhan was supposed to speak at an event which had been organised by a local civic organisation but, in the end, the event had to be abandoned.
ANC Youth League provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo and ANC provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala distanced themselves from the  protest.
“We had nothing to do with that (disruption), we are not anarchists,” Sabelo said.
Zikalala said the ANC condemned what happened “in the strongest terms”.





“People have Constitutional rights to meet and engage on issues affecting society,” said Zikalala.
He said that he would get a proper briefing on what occurred at the Stanger Siva Sungum where the local Concerned Citizens Group had invited Gordhan as a guest speaker at its fundraising dinner.
Two men were seen throwing two buckets filled with faeces at the main entrance before they fled. This was soon before Gordhan’s arrival.
A large group of people, many wearing ANC and ANCYL attire, arrived in bakkies and gathered a few metres from the hall.





Gordhan was whisked away by his bodyguards, but later returned to deliver part of his speech. The event was abandoned when protesters stormed the hall. 
Sabelo said the youth league should not be linked to the protestors.
“We did not know there was going to be a protest,” he said.
He said the youth league would not take action as the protest was not linked to them.
“The ANCYL has never commissioned anyone to go there. We cannot be embarrassed by something we know nothing about."
ANCYL chairman in KwaDukuza Region Mfanafuthi Ngcobo condemned the poo throwing incident. 
ANC greater KwaDukuza region chairperson Ricardo Mthembu also condemned the poo attack, but blamed Gordhan for supporting a faction in the local community.
