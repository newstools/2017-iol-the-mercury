The annual one-day initiative is championed by the World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition which comprises of more than 60 organisations from 27 countries on six continents.
“This year, we are turning World Pancreatic Cancer Day from a day of awareness to a day of action,” said World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition chair Julie Fleshman. 
They said in a statement that more than 1 000 people worldwide were, on a daily basis, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Of that, an estimated 985 will die from the disease. Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate among all major cancers, and in nearly every country, it is the only major cancer with a single-digit five-year survival rate (2-9 percent).
“As we expand our global movement to end pancreatic cancer, we are demanding better for pancreatic cancer patients now and in the future,” explained Fleshman.
There is currently no screening test or early detection method for pancreatic cancer, and though research is being conducted in these areas, knowing the symptoms and risks remains the key to early diagnosis. Research shows that patients diagnosed in time for surgery are more likely to live five years and beyond.
