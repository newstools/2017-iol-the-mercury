KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa said the car chase took place along Dumisani Makhaye Drive, and the suspicious stolen vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, had allegedly been stolen in KwaMakhutha. Two occupants inside the vehicle were driving facing oncoming traffic in a southern direction and crashed into two police vehicles.
The Mercury reported on Wednesday that private security companies were also involved in the chase.
The suspects fled the scene on foot, while firing at the police vehicles. Police also returned fire.
The two suspects were arrested and a 9mm pistol with 10 rounds of ammunition was recovered. A wrist watch and cellphone were among the items seized from the suspects.
Both the suspects and police suffered injuries due to the collision, however no gunshot wounds were sustained. Those injured in the collision were taken to hospital and the suspects are being kept under police guard.
The suspects will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on charges of possession of a suspected stolen vehicle, possession of an unlicensed firearm and attempted murder.
