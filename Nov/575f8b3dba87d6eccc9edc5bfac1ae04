Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda says police should “put criminals down or in prison”, as those were the only two ways out of the life of crime.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Kaunda was addressing a breakfast gathering tackling issues of crime at the Pietermaritzburg City hall on Thursday morning. 
About 200 people attended the gathering including police, mayors, traditional leaders and members of the public.
Kaunda said this festive season police would be out in full force to ensure peace and stability as they had done last year.
“When you are faced with people carrying (guns) you (police) must act to protect yourselves and the public. Whenever I hear there has been an incident, I am not concerned when I hear that criminals have perished. There is only one of two ways a criminal has an exit: it’s either they go to jail or they perish.”

He said: “I get concerned when I have to ask if there had been any police officers that had been injured in that incident. I get concerned because in this country, one police officer is responsible for 500 people, so if one (officer) is no longer there, it means 500 people will not be policed,” he said.
