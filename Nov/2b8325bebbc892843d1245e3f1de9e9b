Judgment has been reserved in the appeal and execution application matters of rival factions of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal who took each other to the Pietermaritzburg High Court over the controversial 2015 provincial elective conference.
The court is tasked with deciding whether the 2015 conference was valid. In a judgment earlier this year, Judge Piet Koen, with two judges concurring, ruled that the conference was null and void due to it being held out of the time frame stipulated by the ANC constitution.

The ANC provincial executive committee (PEC), who were elected at that conference, and the national ANC are appealing that decision.
At the same time, the group of ANC members who brought the matter to court wanted the court ruling by Koen to be executed which would in effect result in the disbanding of the ANC provincial leadership.

After lengthy arguments on Thursday on both issues, the judgment was reserved. 
Regarding the execution order, the court on Thursday from the PEC's lawyer Advocate Greg Harpur SC said the order would affect the salaries of some senior provincial officials, particularly provincial secretary Super Zuma who is the permanent office bearer of the organisation.
