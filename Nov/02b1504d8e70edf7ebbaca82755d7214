Durban - Jacques Pauw, the author of “The President’s Keepers”, has given the go-ahead for readers to continue reading a “hacked and pirated” PDF copy.“If you have a PDF copy and can afford to buy a book, please do it. Erase the PDF and buy a book or the Kindle version. “If you can’t find a book now, read the PDF, but you should still order a book. If you cannot afford a book, go for it and read it. You have my blessing,” Pauw said in a Facebook statement.Pauw said he had been bombarded with requests from people who wanted to pay him for the PDF copies.
