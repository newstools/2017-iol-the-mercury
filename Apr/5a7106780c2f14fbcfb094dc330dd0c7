DURBAN - THIEVES helped themselves to 15 expensive bicycles from a Briardene cycle shop early on Friday morning after forcing open a steel roller door, which they then closed to gather their loot out of the public eye.
However, on leaving, they ran into a security company patrol that had been alerted by an alarm. 
A suspect was arrested and handed to the police, according to Marshall Security.
“They knew what they were going for,” said shop owner Cindy Botha, adding that they had left cheaper bicycles behind and focused on the type that retail for R80 000.
They also took her R1 000 float from her till and “a couple” of customers’ bikes that were in the shop for maintenance.
She said the intruders had also smashed thick glass on entering her shop, Republic Sport Adventure, triggering an alarm that was thought to have been a false alarm.
It went off again as they tried to leave, she said.
Marshall Security spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said two of the high-end bikes were recovered during a search of the surrounds.
Botha said the burglary was the first such incident in 10 years of having the shop.
“Bikes are going for the prices of cars these days. They obviously know the resale value,” said Botha, who said she had heard talk of stolen bicycles being exported.
This month a R130 000 bike was stolen outside a coffee shop and a cyclist was robbed of one worth R90 000 in Durban North, according to reports.
