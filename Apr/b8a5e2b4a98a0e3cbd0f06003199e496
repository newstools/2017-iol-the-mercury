IN JANUARY, Johnny Clegg came face to face with his own mortality. This week he announced his Final Journey tour to bid good bye to his South African fans in eight weeks’ time, followed by concerts in London and Dubai.He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on April 8, 2015. Four days later he was under the surgeon’s knife for a Whipple operation that excised part of his stomach, pancreas, his duodenum and gall bladder and then, in Clegg’s words, “put them back together”.The 63-year-old music icon was lucky; only 15% of patients with pancreatic cancer qualify for the operation. Clegg was put on a round of chemotherapy and carried on with his busy life; delighting fans across the world with his unique brand of music and story-telling.Six weeks after the operation, he was performing at the launch for the Springbok World Cup jersey – but sitting on a stool. He would miss two gigs throughout the entire chemo.* Read the full story in Saturday's edition of the Independent On Saturday, Weekend Argus or/and Saturday Star. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
