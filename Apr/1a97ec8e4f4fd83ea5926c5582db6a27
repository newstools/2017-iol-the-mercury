Netcare 911 spokesman Chris Botha said in a statement that at 02.28am paramedics responded to the incident in Pietermaritzburg. 
“Reports from the scene indicate that a truck driver, a 29-year-old man had stopped at the Church Street off ramp on the N3. (He said) a suspect then climbed into the passenger side of the truck and shot him in the abdomen.
Botha said the truck driver fled from the truck and made his way to a nearby service station to get help. 
“When paramedics arrived at the service station they found the man who is a foreign national, to have sustained a life threatening injury.”
The advanced life support paramedic and his team, he said, worked fervently at the scene to stabilise the critically wounded man before they transported him to a specialised hospital for the care that he required. 
 
“Exact detail to the incident will remain a subject for police investigation and comment.”
