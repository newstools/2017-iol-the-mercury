Actress Emma Stone has cemented her spot as the nicest actor in Hollywood after replying to a high school student who asked her out to his prom.Arizona teenager Jacob Staudenmaier invited the star to his prom in a viral video which saw him recreate the opening scene from La La Land.See the video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7j5wPwPPG8Stone has since responded, with Staudenmaier telling Good Morning America she had contacted him directly.He read out her response:“Jacob, thanks for making the greatest proposal I have ever received. I can’t tell you what an honour that was and how much I smiled through that entire beautifully orchestrated video. I’m in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom, and I’m grateful you thought of me.”Stone capped the message with: “Thank you. P.S. I do see Gosling around the eyes. Love, Emma,” in reference to his ”far-fetched“ lyric which saw him sing he looks like her La La Land co-star.Stone won the Best Actress Oscar for her role of Mia Dolan in Damien Chazelle's hit musical which (eventually) got beaten to the top prize by Barry Jenkins' acclaimed drama Moonlight.
