The chair of the Public Works disciplinary hearing into the awarding of architect Minenhle Makhanya's contract for upgrades on President Jacob Zuma's multi-million-rand Nkandla home, Advocate Thulani Khuzwayo has ruled that Sibusiso Choncho's hearing should be postponed.
"The application for the adjournment is mainly based on the medical notes presented ... In my view, the medical records presented seem unclear as to whether the medical condition the employee suffers from precludes him from attending a disciplinary inquiry. Frankly, they don't allege he is incapable of attending," Khuzwayo said on Tuesday morning.





"Nevertheless ... it will seem prejudicial to the employee if these proceedings were proceeded with, in his present condition. In my view the employee seems to be genuinely sick".
Choncho's hearing was supposed to begin on Monday but could not because he was not present.
He was ordered to come to proceedings on Tuesday and did so, but his lawyer, Adrian Moodley, again asked for a postponement, maintaining that his client was unwell and not fit to sit through the proceedings.
The lawyer acting for Public Works, Clement Kulati, said Choncho was just trying to delay proceedings indefinitely.
He said the documents presented by Moodley were aimed at ensuring the matter "never gets off the ground".
The hearing was adjourned to early July.
