The 57-year-old will be buried near Pietermaritzburg, where some of the elder members of her family still live.
Last Thursday night, Ntuli and seven other family members had gone to bed in their Cornubia home, when a candle was believed to have toppled over and set the couch alight.
The house caught fire, and Ntuli jumped out of the window on the first floor and died. It is believed her neck was broken.
Her son, Sanele Nxumalo, and his daughters and girlfriend also jumped from the window, injuring themselves.
The other family members escaped from the ground floor.
Ward committee member Dudu Phewu said the family was coping.
“They are trying their best but it’s not all good. The youngest daughter, Olwethu, is at the Albert Luthuli Hospital for treatment,” she said.
Nxumalo used a neighbour’s ladder to rescue Olwethu from the flames on the first floor.
“We are also very worried about the family, they are still young. They have not received many donations. I know they don’t have pots to cook in, or a new bed. All their things were burnt in the fire,” she said.
Phewu can be contacted on 071 511 4742 by people wanting to make donations.
