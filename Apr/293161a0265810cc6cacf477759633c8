A 17-year-old girl died Monday after she was seriously injured in a shark attack as she surfed, with her mother and sisters looking on, off the southern coast of Western Australia.The girl was surfing with her father just east of Esperance during an Easter holiday when she was attacked at Kelp Beds surf break, a popular spot for surfers near Wylie Bay. Paramedics treated her on the beach, according to ABC Australia, but she died at a hospital with Yahoo 7 reporting that she had suffered massive injuries to one of her legs.Police confirmed that the teen had died, but did not disclose her identity, saying only that she was from Mandurah, which is near Perth. Sharksmart, the West Australia website that tracks shark activity, reported sightings of a great white shark in the area in the past week, according to The West Australian. There were two fatal shark attacks in West Australia last year.Surfers have been advised to avoid the area for the next 48 hours and Wylie Bay Beach has been closed until further notice. "Our advice to water users is to not undertake surfing, swimming or diving activities in the Wylie Bay area for at least the next 48 hours," Department of Fisheries said. Kelp Beds, known as "Kelpies," is a popular surf break also used for camping and four-wheel driving, according to Caitlyn Rintoul of the Esperance Express.The Washington Post
