DURBAN – His name was not even in the programme but former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, was a welcomed surprise as he received thunderous cheers when he arrived at the SACP’s Chris Hani Commemoration Rally, held at the Durban’s Curries Fountain Stadium yesterday.

This is in contrast to the hostile reception he received recently during the Durban leg of the Ahmed Kathrada memorial, when he, along with ANC Treasurer Zweli Mkhize were booed by supporters of the ANC Youth League, who are seen as being loyal to President Jacob Zuma. But the SACP supporters booed back, this time at a former leader of the ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal and current ANC provincial executive member, Mxolisi Kaunda who was booed during both his introduction and during his speech. Kaunda is also the MEC for Transport in KZN. 



Kaunda kept a straight face and did not acknowledge the chaos as he spoke on the importance of unity within the tripartite alliance and radical economic transformation, while the booing drowned his voice until the SACP leaders, including, general-secretary Blade Nzimande went to the stands to reprimand the crowd. 

Leading the disruptions was the group from Intshanga, south west of Durban, where more than a dozen SACP members have been killed in what is suspected to be due to political tensions between the party and the ANC.

As Kaunda sat down, cheers erupted again as Gordhan stood up to take the podium. 

“Let’s go back to our people at the door-to-door level and explain to them what is state capture, what is corruption, how does tenderising take place and how do we build a better democracy, and what do we actually mean by radical economic transformation which changes the lives all 55million people in South Africa and not just a small group,” he urged.Read the full story in the Sunday Tribune tomorrow.
