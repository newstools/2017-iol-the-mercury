Durban - Six people, including an IFP mayoral candidate, have been arrested in Nquthu for conspiracy to murder a political opponent as the troubled town prepares to hold by-elections in a month's time.
The hung council was dissolved and the municipality placed under administration in February following several failed attempts to elect office-bearers. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Of the arrested, four were IFP candidates and one an EFF candidate. After their arrest last week, the accused appeared in court on Friday and were released on bail of R7000 each.

Reacting to the arrests, the IFP’s Blessed Gwala accused the ANC of using state organs to fight political battles. The claims were rubbished by the ANC as “baseless”.

He said the ANC was using the Hawks to prevent IFP candidates from campaigning. He also accused the ANC of waging psychological warfare aimed at making the electorate believe IFP leaders were murderous.

“We were the first to receive death threats in the run-up to last year's local government elections. The situation was so bad our candidates had to leave their homes for fear of being killed. We reported the matter to the police but nothing was ever done. But when the ANC complains, IFP members get arrested,” he said. 

Gwala said the IFP would support the accused members as it knew they had done no wrong. 

Mdumiseni Ntuli, ANC provincial spokesperson, described Gwala’s comments as “unfortunate and immature”. 

He said that just before council was dissolved, ANC members had received death threats, resulting in the party involving the police.

“IFP members were not arrested by the ANC. The fact that we complained of death threats and IFP members were arrested is pure coincidence. Our leaders have been killed, we have never gone on to accuse other political parties, we have made it clear that murderous thugs must be arrested and prosecuted,” Ntuli said. 

The ANC controls nine of the 11 districts in the province.
