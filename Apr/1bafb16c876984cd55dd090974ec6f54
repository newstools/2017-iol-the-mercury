Johannesburg - President Zuma cut a lonely figure when he attended the Good Friday service of the Universal Church of Kingdom of God at the Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg on Friday.
Last year, he was accompanied to the service by ANC Gauteng chairperson and Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile and Water and Sanitation Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who is among the president’s staunchest allies in the cabinet.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

On Friday Zuma found solace in the company of Gauteng MEC for Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation Faith Mazibuko and other dignitaries.

The president stuck to script, much like last year, saying little more than asking the clergy to pray for them.

Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe told congregants at the Assemblies of God at Thaba Nchu in Free State yesterday that the church provided “the moral compass to the nation” and that religious leaders had always been part of human struggles.

DA leader Mmusi Maimane implored church leaders to “pray for the country during trying and irregular times”.
