The Durban Hub was established in 2013 and forms part of an international network of 452 hubs all over the world. Hubs are developed and led by young people, primarily between the ages of 20 and 30, who are exceptional in their potential, achievements and drive to make a difference in their communities.Durban Hub curator Mandisa Ntombela said: “We are absolutely proud of the chosen shapers. Our vision is to change, build and inspire active citizenship, we have the utmost confidence in their ability to fully represent the concerns of the young people of Durban.”Matarutse, policy and advocacy manager at the Durban Chamber of Commerce, said: “It’s a great honour to be part of the most important global gathering, to discuss the African economy. After this, we hope to come out with a clearer perspective of how we can be active in building a thriving city.”The Durban Global Shapers will engage WEFA17 delegates over the three-day programme through a series of activities, including welcoming the other Global Shapers at the King Shaka Airport, and hosting a closed cruise trip around the Durban Harbour and Made in Africa – a fashion exhibition and pop-up market at the Durban Exhibition Centre during the event. The overall theme for the WEFA forum meeting is “achieving inclusive growth” and the global shapers will put a spotlight on how the city can strengthen economic resilience and achieve inclusive growth for all.For more information about the Durban Global Shapers, e-mail mandisa@durbangs.co.za, phone 082 614 8451 or visit www.globalshapers.org/hubs/durban.
