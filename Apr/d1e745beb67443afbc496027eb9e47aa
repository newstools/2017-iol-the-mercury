UPDATE: The death toll has now risen to 14, with two other passengers dying in hospital this evening. The 13th victim died before 5pm on Saturday, while the 14th died just before 6.30pm.  

BRAKE failure could have been the cause of the deadly accident that claimed the lives of at least 12 people who were travelling to a traditional ceremony when their bus crashed yesterday.

The bus, with a Durban registration plate, lost control on Nkandla Road near the Ntunjambili area, crashed into a tree and then overturned, killing 12 people. Fifteen other passengers were injured and taken to the Ntunjambili Hospital.

KZN Emergency Services spokesperson Robert McKenzie said of the 15 injured, eight were critical and seven were seriously injured.

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said it was believed the group was travelling to a traditional ceremony, possibly lobola, in Hluhluwe. She said the bus lost control before it crashed into a tree and overturned, killing 12 people.

KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has ordered an investigation into the crash and said he would released the findings of the accident report soon.

“We are really hurt and disappointed at this disaster which occurred after we have been working for weeks to avoid such disasters. Traffic officers have been placed on full alert and have been tasked to get engineers to get into the bottom of this matter,” said Kaunda in a statement.

Kaunda urged motorists to drive safely.

“We wish to, once again, urge people of KwaZulu-Natal to make sure that they drive safely and do not worsen the situation. Passengers should check on the condition of drivers and vehicles they are using.

“Our message to all people of KwaZulu-Natal is that safety, both on our roads and in our communities, is a collective responsibility for all of us,” said Kaunda.
