The men were arrested during a swoop by SAPS and the US Department of Homeland Security, after a child pornography website was red-flagged when one of the suspects, a 29-year-old from Pinetown, accessed the site. 
After his arrest, he spilled the beans on the other two suspects, a 47-year-old man from the Bluff and a 35-year-old from Waterfall, who were subsequently arrested. 
The 29-year-old was released on bail, while the 47-year-old has also been charged with rape, sexual assault and grooming a 6-year-old child for pornographic purposes. 
On Friday, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said the case had been postponed until July for a cyber crime report and further particulars. 
* The suspects are not being named because they have not pleaded.
