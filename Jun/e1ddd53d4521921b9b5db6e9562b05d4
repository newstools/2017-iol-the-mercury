Umgeni Water, the bulk water supplier for Durban and Pietermaritzburg, has cautioned that the province was not yet safe from worsening drought conditions.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Umgeni Water spokesperson Shami Harichunder said they would intensify messages to communities that water shortages were still in place.
“The Mgeni system cannot meet the full water requirements of uMgungundlovu, Pietermaritzburg and Durban,” he said.
This meant that water restrictions of 15% have been implemented in Pietermaritzburg, uMgungundlovu and about 80% of Durban.
“At the same time, Umgeni Water has introduced water rationing through a cut of 15% in potable water production at its water treatment plants at Midmar, Pietermaritzburg and Durban.” He said water conservation initiatives would continue because available water would have to last “until the dry spell ends”.
“Prospects for good rains at the end of winter did not look promising, as forecast by the South African Weather Service and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.”
Harichunder said projections were that rains, expected at well below average, were likely to occur only in September or the first quarter of 2018.
“Rainfall predictions are what they are: predictions. Our objective is to ensure that water available lasts until the dams fill up again.
"In order to effectively execute this, water restrictions and reduced consumption are imperative.” 
Umgeni Water would try to ensure that available water lasts until dams fill up again, he said. “We have had discussions about easing restrictions, but a decision was taken to stay with 15%.
“If we make changes at this stage and rains do not materialise, it is possible that restrictions of 20% would have to be implemented in the new year. The sacrifices we make now could ease hardship in future,” he said.
The latest figures in the Mgeni system: Midmar Dam was at 81%; Albert Falls 34%; Nagle Dam 89%; Inanda Dam 68%; Spring Grove Dam 87%; and Mearns Weir 38%.
