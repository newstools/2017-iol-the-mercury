TNA breakfast has been a subject of controversy for some time now. Recently, the Minister of Communications announced that R988 689.84 had been spent on the show.
The New Age’s business briefings were a subject of review by the interim board of the SABC which has been in the process of implementing the list of recommendations by the ad hoc committee of inquiry.
Last month, interim board member Krish Naidoo told the communications committee that they had written to The New Age requesting a meeting to discuss contracts they entered into with the SABC, among others. This was in compliance with the ad hoc committee recommendation that the interim board evaluate the feasibility of the business case for entering into agreements with rival broadcasters such as ANN7 and DSTV.

During the hearings of the parliamentary inquiry, stakeholders such as Right2Know and SOS Coalition, had called for the termination of the relationship between the SABC and The New Age.
The inquiry heard conflicting evidence regarding the SABC’s involvement in the TNA business breakfasts.
Former acting chief executive Phil Molefe testified that former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng had initiated meetings with The New Age’s Tony Gupta in July 2011.
During the enquiry the Ex-SABC journalist Vuyo Mvoko also gave evidence that SABC resources were diverted to fund ANN7 and the business briefings generated no revenue.
According to Kweyama based on the boards decision there will be no more TNA Breakfast showcased by the SABC. Kweyama indicated that last week’s show would be the last one to be showcased on SABC.
