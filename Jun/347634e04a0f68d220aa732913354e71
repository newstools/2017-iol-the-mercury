For one couple, the end of this Comrades Marathon was the start of their life together.
Carl Hansen was on his knees on the finishing mat but not for the same reason most of his fellow runners were.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He used the opportunity to propose, bearing a sign that read “Nicole ‘Fairychild’ Matthews, will you marry me? Let’s go the distance!”
An overwhelmed Matthews, who had been surprised when she was specially invited to the finish line by the Comrades Marathon Association, was taken by surprise.
With teary eyes and a wide grin across her face, she said “Yes!” and the crowd erupted in cheers.
“I was always wondering when I'm going to marry her and I've been dreaming of doing Comrades since I was a kid,” Hansen said afterwards, “I thought what better moment to live my dream and give her her dream too”.
The couple had been dating for four years.
Asked if they had a date in mind, Hansen said not yet.
Hansen was not a lifelong runner and took up the sport in order to do the Comrades Marathon.
He said the race was “very, very hard” but he managed to finish before the cut off, in a time of 11.13:20.
“But if I can do that, I can please one woman for the rest of my life,” he laughed.
