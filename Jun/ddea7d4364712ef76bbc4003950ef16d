SAA Chairperson Dudu Myeni’s application to have a compliance notice against her, issued by the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission, set aside was dismissed with costs by the Companies Tribunal yesterday. “The respondent (Companies and Intellectual Property Commission) issued the compliance notice to the applicant (Myeni) on November 28, 2016. The applicant complied with the compliance notice and, under protest, requested the respondent to issue a compliance certificate, which it did on January 25, 2017,” Peter Veldhuizen of the tribunal’s presiding panel said, presenting the decision at a media briefing in Pretoria. Veldhuizen said a compliance notice remained in full force until a compliance certificate was issued.

This is so, despite the nature of the circumstances under which the compliance certificate was issued - including when the compliance certificate was issued under protest or where there are grounds to impugn the preceding compliance notice,” Veldhuizen read out the findings. “The decision is therefore that the application for the review of the compliance certificate is dismissed, with costs”.
