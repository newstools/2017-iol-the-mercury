Sectors that shed jobs were agriculture (44000), trade (15000) and government (2000).

Investec economist, Kamilla Kaplan said yesterday that economic growth had essentially stagnated in 2016 “and we forecast only a modest recovery in growth towards 2percent by 2021. As such, unemployment rates are likely to remain stubbornly high.

“The recent political developments and the subsequent credit rating downgrades are perceived to have heightened policy uncertainty and further undermined business confidence. This suggest that the prospects for a meaningful recovery in private sector fixed investment and employment are poor,” said Kaplan.

Kaplan said the International Monetary Fund had recommended that “the priority to stimulate economic growth and job creation rests with structural reforms, notably in product and service markets and in the labour market”.

She said the recent cabinet reshuffle and prevailing political tensions had raised concerns that the government shift focus from implementing the required structural reforms. This, she said, was a contributing factor to the sovereign credit rating downgrades by ratings agencies, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings.
