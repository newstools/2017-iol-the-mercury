Results showing that Baby Jayden died of pneumonia are expected to be confirmed this week, while results of an independent post mortem will also be released.  Jayden Khoza died during a service delivery protest in Clare Estate’s Foreman Road informal settlement last month. His parents and shackdwellers organisation Abahlali Basemjondolo believed that the two-week-old died due to tear gas fired by police which landed outside the informal dwelling he was in.  Shortly after Jayden’s death, police said a state post mortem confirmed that he had died of natural causes.  Yesterday, queries were referred to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).Spokes person Moses Dlamini said the state pathologist had not found indication of tear gas in Jayden’s lungs.  “The PM (post mortem) found that he could have been infected by pneumonia. This finding will be confirmed by means of a histology report. That report is still outstanding,” said Dlamini.  Meanwhile, Abahlali’s Sbu Zikode said they were expecting the results of a second and independent post mortem done this week.
