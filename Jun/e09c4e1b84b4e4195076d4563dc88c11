By 6pm the rand gained 0.7percent to R12.9950 to the dollar, dipping below R13 for the first time since Monday.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Meanwhile, shares dipped. The benchmark JSE Top40 index fell 0.59percent to 44944.65 points, while the all share index was down 0.64percent to close at 51072.86 points.

“The market has been fairly negative, we’ve had our futures edging down all day and basically people have been selling off the rest of the market,” said Cratos Capital stock broker, Yusuf Mola.
