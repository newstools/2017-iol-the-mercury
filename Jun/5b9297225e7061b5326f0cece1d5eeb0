Durban – Female journalists were an easy target for online bullies who bombard their social media accounts with death threats and derogatory remarks.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Far from simply donning a virtual “bulletproof vest”, journalists have been called on to “name and shame” those who target them online.
Speaking at the World News Media Congress in Durban on Thursday, journalists shared their experiences of being harassed online when researching, or publishing stories.
“When you go out to cover a war, you know what the potential threats are. However, with online you don’t know where the threats will come from, I have young female reporters who work in the newsroom and we send them for counselling for the types of online abuse that they face. Because the news is driven on social media, the online world can be so toxic, and it’s difficult as young journalists, and as females, to deal with this because it should not be considered part of the job of being a journalist,” said Maria Ressa, who runs online social media news platform called Rappler in the Philippines.
Ferial Haffajee, editor at large of the Huffington Post South Africa, said she had faced many instances of online bullying.
“I didn’t know at the time that the bullying happened disproportionately to women. I discovered Twitter had quite a dark heart. On the net, I found people had used creative ways to depict distorted images of myself as a stripper, or a dog. Because I had written hard stories I thought I had no right to say anything online and the bullying was normal. But I realised this is a global phenomenon, and it is not normal or acceptable,” said Haffajee.
Some of the suggestions put forward by the media panel was for online bullies to be “name and shamed” online, and for cases, especially death threats, to be opened with the police, and for reporters to be sent for counselling to deal with bullying, and for online tools to be created to track down bullies for prosecution.
