A man in his 30s was shot dead in an armed robbery in Doonside, eManzimtoti, on KwaZulu Natal’s south coast, on Monday morning.

ER24 Spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene to find the man lying motionless inside a shop.

“The man was assessed by ER24 paramedics and found to have sustained a fatal gunshot wound to his chest and showed no signs of life,” Meiring said, “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene”.

It is believed that the man was approached by the gunmen as was walking into the store.

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the incident took place at around 6.40am.

“Three suspects armed with firearms entered the business premises and demanded cash,” Mbhele said, “The suspects shot the victim and he sustained a gunshot wound to his chest”. 

She said charges of murder and business robbery were being investigated by police.
