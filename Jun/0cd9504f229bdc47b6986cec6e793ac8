DURBAN - As the University of KwaZulu-Natal medical school’s places for sale saga develops, more information has emerged regarding an alleged syndicate’s national links to other universities.
The Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU), formerly known as Medunsa, said this week  it was following up on the observations from the UKZN investigation, implicating certain individuals associated with SMU. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The interim vice-chancellor, Professor Chris de Beer, commissioned this investigation. 

“The university will provide further information as appropriate. SMU is committed to a policy and value framework of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption,” said  spokesman Eric Pule.  

SMU’s investigation follows the arrest in Durban of three people alleged to have been selling places to study medicine and other health science courses at UKZN for a fee of up to R500 000.

The three are the owners of Durban’s popular Little Gujarat Restaurants, Varsha and Hiteshkumar Bhatt, and an uMhlanga businesswoman, Preshni Hiramun. 

The Sunday Tribune has received several tip-offs that the syndicate was operating in other universities.
Meanwhile, UKZN is still appealing to anyone with information, or to students who may have paid bribes, to come forward. 

They have set up a toll-free fraud hotline for this purpose. All reports will be treated in of confidence. The toll free number is 0800 20 32 85. 

The university’s executive management said it was concerned about  the negative effect that any corruption of the admission processes would have on the institution's reputation. 

“Additional checks and balances in our admission processes led to the detection of corrupt practices, which were referred to the Hawk, and we are continually improving our procedures  to reduce risks,” vice- chancellor Dr Albert Van Jaarsveld said.
