The NSRI said its Plettenberg Bay and NSRI Knysna volunteer crews continued to help those affected by the fires that have devastated the Eden and Bitou Districts of the Southern Cape between Sedgefield and Plettenberg Bay.Spokesperson Craig Lambinon said there had been mass destruction to land and properties, causing injuries and the loss of life.It’s believed at least six people have been killed in the fires that have plagued the region over the past week. Weekend Argus reported that by Saturday night the death toll had risen to six with the death of 63-year-old John Blaauw in Concordia near Knysna.Police spokesman Captain Malcolm Pojie said the incident occurred shortly after 3pm, when Blaauw, who was driving a vehicle transporting workers near Windheuwel, was trapped by raging fires.Lambinon said the NSRI Port Elizabeth, NSRI Jeffreys Bay and NSRI St Francis Bay were supporting NSRI Knysna and NSRI Plettenberg Bay stations with drinking water, essential needs, medical consumables, food, clothing, blankets and medical oxygen.He said the NSRI was co-ordinating fundraising for the sea rescue stations deployed. Details are on the institute’s Facebook page.“The NSRI Facebook page and the NSRI web page have details posted on how to continue support for the NSRI stations, Knysna and Plettenberg Bay, and the national public response continues to be applauded during this difficult time,” said Lambinon.Both sea rescue stations have continued to assist the emergency services and the public with fire fighting, co-ordination of resources, evacuations, relief efforts, manning of the Joint Operations Control Centres and medical treatment of the sick and injured, animal evacuations and monitoring of flare ups brought by Berg wind conditions and strong winds.Lambinon said in rough conditions, NSRI Knysna launched sea rescue craft to evacuate residents from Belvidere and sea rescue craft continued to be used to ferry people across the Knysna Lagoon and from upstream of the Knysna River throughout the ordeal.NSRI Knysna continued with water distribution from a warehouse during the night and NSRI Plettenberg Bay was fighting fires from flare-ups throughout the night. Fire fighting efforts continued across the Bitou District around Plettenberg Bay.Lambinon said from Sunday morning that NSRI Wilderness had been placed on high alert to assist emergency services with possible evacuations from Buffels Bay and Sedgefield where a Northerly wind has caused the fires to turn to heading Easterly and threatening these areas.
