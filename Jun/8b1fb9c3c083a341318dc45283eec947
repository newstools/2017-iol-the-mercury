Ford South Africa has reportedly announced a fire-risk related recall of Ford Figo and Ikon models. The Herald in Port Elizabeth said owners of 15 600 petrol-engined Figos and Ikons built in India between August 2004 and March 2012 and sold in South Africa received e-mails from the car maker on Wednesday asking them to “immediately” contact a Ford dealership to replace their vehicle’s power steering high pressure hose.

The customer e-mails said: “The hose may split resulting in a power steering fluid leak (which may make it) possible for power steering fluid to come into contact with the vehicle’s exhaust system components creating the potential for smoke and in extreme cases fire.” ADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsBUSINESS REPORT
