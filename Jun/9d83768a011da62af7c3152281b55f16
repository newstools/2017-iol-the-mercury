For Lee Holwill, Sunday's Spar Women’s Race – dubbed the country’s most beautiful race – was about just one thing: spending time with his little girl, Brooklyn.
The father-daughter team was one of 14 697 participants in the annual event, which included a 5km and 10 km race.
Gillitts resident Holwill – who participated in the 5km race while pushing his daughter, who suffers from cerebral palsy, in her wheelchair – said that the race had gone very well.
“The atmosphere has been great and the event itself was well organised. We had a great time.”
Brooklyn, he said, had a “wonderful time”.
The 10-year-old, who attends Brown’s School in Pinetown, enjoyed the outing.
The pair were looking to make the walks a regular part of their routine.
“This is definitely something we will be doing more of. We are looking at the calendar now to see what our event will be. If it can accommodate Brooklyn, then we’ll be there.”
Fellow participants Karita Pillay, Amy Sookdaw and Delereeze Govender – all dressed in their favourite superhero costumes – said they had been inspired by the race’s theme of “SHEroes”.
The trio also participated in last year’s race.
Meanwhile, organisers told The Mercury the race had been fairly uneventful in terms of medical emergencies.
One participant had to be taken to Addington Hospital to be treated for the effects of low blood sugar. 
“She participated in the event having done no training and was sick with the flu. Other than that, a few people tripped on the road, resulting in a scraped knee or hand.”
