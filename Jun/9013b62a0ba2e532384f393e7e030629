Jamieson said paramedics performed emergency resuscitation attempts on the driver, but he unfortunately passed away at the scene due to his severe injuries. A passenger was seriously injured.

The vehicle crashed through a fence and struck the side of the house at what appeared to be a boma.

In an earlier incident on the roads a couple broke down on the N2 freeway in the vicinity of Lamontville. When the male driver walked to find petrol the woman was assaulted as robbers broke the vehicleâ€™s window with a brick. They robbed her and fled the scene.

Rescue Care reported that on Umgeni Road, near the N2 earlier on Wednesday morning, a protester threw a petrol bomb into a truck, causing major damage to the vehicle and slight injuries to two men. Traffic on the M19 and N2 were backed up.
