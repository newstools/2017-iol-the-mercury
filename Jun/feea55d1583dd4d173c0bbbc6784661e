While punters gather every morsel of useful information in their quest to pick the winner of the R4.25 million Vodacom Durban July, others choose alternative methods.Some turn to mystics, while tarot cards readers and fortune tellers also do a roaring trade at this time of year.One of the race’s traditions is the bean forecasting, believed to have been started by The Mercury's former Idler columnist Jack Shepherd Smith. Twenty identical beans are planted as soon as the final field is announced, each bean being allocated a runner in the main race.As race day draws closer, the progress made by the growing beans is meant to give a clue to the winner at Greyville Racecourse on Saturday afternoon.If this year’s crop is anything to go on, it will be a very close finish, with Marinaresco right in the action, but being shaded on the line by French Navy.
