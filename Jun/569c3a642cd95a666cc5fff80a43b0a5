This is what it takes to win the WAN-IFRA Golden Pen of Freedom award. Courage, endurance, guts and a refusal to give up on principles in the face of violent obstruction to efforts to carry out journalistic work.The World News Media Congress under the auspices of WAN-IFRA on Wednesday night awarded its Golden Pen of Freedom award to journalist Can Dundar, who has been reporting on the political situation in Turkey for years.Dundar, the World Editors Forum said, had fought harassment under president Tayyip Erdogan, and the Turkish assault on democracy and a free press. As an editor in chief Dundar was arrested, harassed, threatened, spent 92 days in prison, and was eventually freed after a Supreme Court ruling. He currently lives in exile in Germany, having survived an assassination attempt. His wife remains in the country, her passport seized and unable to travel. Some of his colleagues have been imprisoned for 220 days.WAN-IFRA said the award was made each year in recognition of an outstanding action, in writing or deed, of an individual to the cause of press freedom.The winners have stories of extraordinary personal courage and self-sacrifice, they may have been imprisoned, suffered beatings, witnessed bombings and possibly been forced into exile.Thomas Brunegard, the organisation’s president, officially welcomed participants to the 69th edition of the congress and 24th World Editors Forum.Brunegard said the conference was an opportunity to “Listen, learn, debate and exchange ideas. It is our way to move societies and ourselves forward.”He said it was very special to be back in Africa again after 10 years, and that he believed “booming” Africa was the future for the industry.Brunegard described a free press as the cornerstone of a free and prosperous society.He picked out US president Donald Trump, whom he said had labelled a free press as “the enemy”.“The truth will out. It is still so often the press that uncovers the truth in the world,” said Brunegard.The WAN-IFRA president congratulated South Africans and the judiciary in protecting the freedom of the media.In a statement yesterday, the organisation’s board drew attention to the Cybercrime Bill as an “assault on the right to digital privacy” and a threat to the protection of journalists’ sources, while it said it also supported on-going efforts to challenge the 2002 Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act.‘’The Board of WAN-IFRA denounced the draft Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, which would criminalize "bringing contempt and ridicule" onto figures of authority, as well as the Film & Publication Board Amendment Bill, which broadens state power to censor content.”While President Jacob Zuma was scheduled to attend the opening last night, Brunegard said Zuma was unable to depart Cape Town due to the inclement weather that had hit the Western Cape. He said they would attempt to secure Zuma’s presence on one of the other days.
