DURBAN – Media experts at the World News Media Congress in Durban discussed ways to combat fake news spreading like wildfire online on Friday.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Traditional media like newspapers, were possibly failing to engage with the new media user, that demanded news immediately, and react to issues as it happens.
Kjersti Loken Stavrum, of Norway’s Tinius Trust, said there was a massive demand from media audiences for news to be delivered in a different way, because fake news was constructed and delivered in a way that appealed to people.
“As media we have to respond to this onslaught of fake news. We can learn from the online principles and learn to present the news in a manner that is usable, findable, valuable, credible, accessible, and desirable. This amounts to the whole online user experience, but remains professional journalism,” said Stavrum.
Espen Egil Hansen, editor in chief of the Norwegian paper Aftenposten, called on social network platforms to acknowledge that they have control over the content that is published on their platforms, as another way to stop fake news and social media being used for propaganda.
Famously known as the #dearmark editor, Hansen took issue with Facebook censoring an image he put on his paper’s Facebook page, and wrote to Facebook challenging the decision.
“There are several companies that are the top tech companies in the world, yet they are seen to be platforms and not publishers. Yet Facebook will censor certain things, and I have an issue with that if they want to only to be seen as a platform. Tech companies and the media can work together to ensure there is no mistrust in the news that goes out,” he said.
