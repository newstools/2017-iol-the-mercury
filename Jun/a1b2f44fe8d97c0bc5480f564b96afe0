KwaZulu-Natal Health Department head Dr Sifiso Mtshali has hit back at claims he was responsible for the cancer treatment crisis at state facilities in the province.He insisted he inherited the problems when he took office two years ago. As the accounting officer, I do the final sign-of, but I cannot say I failed in this crisis. All decisions taken are collective; so there must be collective responsibility. The procurement process is driven by those below me, which includes supply chain management, the bid adjudication committee and the chief financial officer who ultimately ensures all processes have been followed. Mtshali s comments follow Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi saying Mtshali had botched the procurement of oncology machines. The controversy over who to blame came after a report by the SA Human Rights Commission, which blamed Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and the department for violating the rights of cancer patients. However, Premier Willies Mchunu and Motsoaledi have come out in support of Dhlomo, saying he was not to blame as there was there was no dereliction of duty on his part.The issue surrounds the lack of a single oncologist in the public health sector and a controversial maintenance contract for radiotherapy machines at Addington hospital which are no longer being serviced.While agreeing he needed to take responsibility for signing off contracts, Mtshali insisted all decisions were discussed with the MEC. Our management meetings include all chief directors, deputy directors-general and often the MEC. This is where all decisions are taken and discussed. One must also remember that this issue around the machines began in 2009, long before I started as head of department. I do not think I have failed. Certain things needed to be corrected that were happening,. which I tried to do. I am focused on service delivery and that s what I will continue to do, said Mtshali.&nbsp;Follow Sunday Tribune on TwitterFollow on FacebookSUNDAY TRIBUNE
