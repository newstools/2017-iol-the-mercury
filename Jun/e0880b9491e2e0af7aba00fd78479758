Hisense South Africa started in Atlantis, (Western Cape) by manufacturing flat-screen televisions and refrigerators at the plant, recruiting and training 300 previously unemployed citizens. At the time the company planned to double the size of the factory over the next few years, and increase its staff complement to 1 000 people, with a view to extending production to washing machines, air conditioning units and, possibly, wine coolers and coffee machines.
During this period the factory was one of only five established by the company outside of China â€“ to produce its goods for local consumption to begin with, but ultimately export into other parts of Africa.
Hisense South Africa is a great example of economic relations between South Africa and China.
