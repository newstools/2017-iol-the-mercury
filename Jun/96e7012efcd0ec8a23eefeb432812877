“We aim to find creative, workable solutions that we can implement collaboratively as affected stakeholders in Durban,” DCCI chief executive Dumile Cele said. “Working with law-enforcement agencies, business is looking for constructive ways it can partner with government and civil society. Busting crime and grime is a key vision of the Durban Chamber to protect existing businesses and attract more investment into the city. It is also important to ensure that no human suffers through the hands of another.”
Jewellery and cellphone outlets have been particularly badly hit. Shops hit in recent months include outlets in Southway Mall; the Pearls Mall; the Atrium; Musgrave Centre; Westwood Mall; Chatsworth Centre; La Lucia Mall; Montclair Mall; Gateway; The Pavilion; Tiffany’s Centre; Bluff Towers; Malvern Centre; Chatsworth Centre; Scottburgh Mall; Pine Crest Mall; Kloof Village Mall and Watercrest Mall.
Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the force had been liaising with the DCCI and had appealed to malls to beef up security. “Criminals are exploiting the fact that security at certain malls is insufficient,”he said.
The Jewellery Council of SA said it was working closely with the Consumer Goods Council of SA (CGCSA), which, in turn, is working with SAPS. 
“The CGCSA is in the process of establishing provincial SAPS task teams in KZN and Gauteng, where perpetrators in… smash-and-grab robberies have been seen,” said Lorna Lloyd, chief executive of the Jewellery Council.
