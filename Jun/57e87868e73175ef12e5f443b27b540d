DURBAN â€“ A young Durban North Springbok fan got an unexpected gift ahead of Friday's Moses Mabhida Stadium rugby debut, where the South Africa 'A' team will face the French Barbarians.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Virginia Preparatory School's 12-year-old Christiano Pereira, alongside his grandparents Marianne and Manuel Franco, managed to secure autographs from both the Boks of the South Africa 'A' team and players from the French Barbarians.
He was at a reception ahead of Friday's clash. The enterprising Durban North lad had brought a sweatshirt to the event, which was hosted by the French Ambassador Christophe Farnaud at the Alliance Francaise in Morningside on Wednesday night, and gathered the players' autographs.
The reception was attended by members of the two teams, which met on Wednesday night ahead of the first rugby match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup Stadium, and in celebration of the close sporting ties enjoyed by both countries. The ambassador welcomed the guests and players in a short speech which, among other things, noted that sport was a great unifier.
The young Pereira and his grandparents will attend Saturday's Test match between the Boks and France. His prediction: with Jesse Kriel out injured with a concussion after having played well in the first Test, he's not willing to nail his colours to the poles.

The South Africa 'A' will play the French Barbarians at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday, while the Springboks will clash with France on Saturday at the Growthpoint Kings Park Stadium.
