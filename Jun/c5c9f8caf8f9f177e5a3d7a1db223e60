The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture has assembled a provincial task team to monitor for avian flu.&nbsp; Spokesperson Khaye Nkwanyana said in a statement yesterday that the team comprised department veterinarians who were monitoring the province, particularly districts bordering Mpumalanga and the Free State where cases of the H5N8 avian flu have been confirmed.&nbsp; The confirmation of cases led to a nationwide ban on the sale of live chickens by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.&nbsp; Nkwanyana said KZN was on high alert and the department s local offices were working with poultry farmers and maintaining contact with communities.&nbsp; KwaZulu-Natal has many households which have chickens for subsistence so it is important that we have a strong interface so we can keep the information flowing and escalate to the task team in the event that there are reported indications and signs of avian flu, he said.&nbsp; Nkwanyana called on communities to monitor their stock and if they see any signs of distress, like their chickens having difficulty breathing, swollen wattles and combs or the sudden deaths of chickens, to immediately notify local offices.&nbsp; The team on the ground will escalate to the provincial team which will immediately come and quarantine those areas and therefore eliminate those affected chickens to stop the spread of this Avian flu throughout the province but also throughout the country, he said.&nbsp;
