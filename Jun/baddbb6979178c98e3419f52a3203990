After traversing 230 km across the Drakensberg over 13 days, the Climb for K9 expedition has racked up an impressive R104 000 for its chosen cause. The three hikers from KwaZulu-Natal Grant Melville, Ian Shooter and Jeffery Mthabela each have extensive bush experience and made the trip unassisted with only one re-supply stop.They were raising funds for dogs working for anti-poaching units at the Kruger National Park and also want to raise awareness about the Berg s unique wilderness and wildlife conservation. After a fantastic send-off on May 25 from the Phuthaditjhaba (Witsieshoek) in Free State, the Climb for K9 expedition scaled the Chain Ladders and summitted the 3000m Mont aux Sources and Stimela Peaks within the first three days.Read more here: A hike with a purpose (We) proceeded towards Champagne Castle, and scaled Mafadi, Giant s Castle and finally the Thabana Ntlenyana, the highest point in Lesotho and the highest mountain in southern Africa, said Melville in a written account of the hike.Having hiked completely unassisted, the hikers arrived at Sani Mountain Lodge for a much needed first and only re-supply of food and gear on the tenth day.They completed the final 42km in only two days.The Climbers for K9, they said in a statement, were presented with the special edition SANParks K9 medallions for exceptional support to the SANParks K9 anti-poaching Unit.Speaking at the celebration, Melville emphasised the important work being done by the anti-poaching K9 Unit to safeguard the wildlife in our national parks, which was under heavy threat from poachers.&nbsp; The number of rhino poached in Kruger National Park dropped by 20% in 2016, and the number of arrests of poachers doubled, and the dogs were involved in 90% of these successful arrests, so they are making a big difference.&nbsp;This unfortunately means that softer targets like the rhino in KZN are now facing an increase in attacks by poachers, he said.Read more here: Climb for K9: The expedition continuesTo date, the expedition has raised nearly R 104 000 for the SANParks anti-poaching K9 unit: R57 700 in funds and R46 200 worth of dog food, blankets and veterinary supplies.
