The Sunday Tribune reported at the weekend that six men had escaped from the police station on May 30.
At the time, three had been rearrested.
The newspaper said in its report: “It is unclear why the detainees were being kept at the police station’s holding cells when Empangeni Correctional Services is situated next door, separated only by a fence.”
SAPS spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala told The Mercury on Monday: “We confirm the three suspects are re-arrested and three are still at large. We appeal to community members not to try and apprehend them since they are dangerous. They rather contact nearest police stations as soon as they spot them.”
Police spokesman Colonel Thulani Zwane said at the time: “Cases of escaping from lawful custody were opened at Empangeni police station for investigation.”
The three suspects still on the run are Sandile Majola, 29, Mxolisi Mbuyazi, 22, and Thanda Zulu, 32.
