KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu, Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and Finance MEC Belinda Scott will all appear before the provincial legislature on Thursday to present a series of interventions aimed at turning around the situation in the Department of Health.
The interventions come after a SA Human Rights Commission report found that the rights of cancer patients had been violated.
Mchunu said: “We agreed that there is an urgent need for decisive intervention to ensure the provision of quality patient care to patients that are in need of oncology services. The provincial executive council subsequently received briefings from the MEC for Finance and MEC for Health about proposed interventions.
“We have paid particular attention to challenges related to availability of clinicians attached to oncology services, supply chain management and procurement in general,” said Mchunu.
In a recent televised interview with eNCA, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that over the past two weeks he had sent two different teams led by his director and deputy director-general to KZN. 
He said these fact-finding missions had revealed that the problems had nothing to do with oncologists but procurement issues. Oncologists were leaving because there was inactivity as machines were not working. 
“They are not doing procurement the way it should be done. The HOD has hoarded delegations. If you're running a hospital, especially big ones with oncology, there must be delegated power so that if anything goes wrong they can maintain equipment or repair it or even sometimes purchase it.” He said the contract to maintain equipment was given to a company that was unable to perform that function.
As for who should ultimately be held responsible, Motsoaledi said that was up to the premier, whom he had met last week. However, he could not disclose details of their discussion.
