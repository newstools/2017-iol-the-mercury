An 11-year-old has scored higher in an IQ test than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The genius benchmark is set at 140 and Arnav Sharma scored 162.&nbsp; This is two points higher than theoretical physicist Einstein and celebrated cosmologist Hawking. Arnav, from Reading in the UK, passed the infamously difficult test with zero preparation and had never seen what a typical paper looked like. His mark, The Independent reported, puts him in the top one percent of the nation in terms of IQ level. Arnav, of Indian origin, said he had had no preparation but was not nervous. &quot;My family were surprised but they were also very happy about the result. Meesha Dhamija Sharma, his mother, said she kept her fingers crossed for the whole exam. Meesha said she first became aware of Arnav s mathematical prowess when he was about 2-and-a-half. He was counting up to more than 100. That was when I stopped teaching him because I came to know that there is no end to his numbers. Arnav, who attends Crossfields School on the outskirts of Reading, has been selected for Eton College and Westminster, both highly competitive and sought-after schools. - The Independent See video footage here: http://iol.io/bc745&nbsp;
