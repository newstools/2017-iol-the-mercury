DURBAN - CHOOSING between orange and jewelled slip slops was difficult for Sibongile Mhlongo.

Yesterday, however, she and hundreds of other homeless people in Durban were treated to a “shopping” experience where they could choose clothing from donated items.

“I’m so happy, I thank Jesus,” said the 46-year-old, who calls the streets of Durban’s Warwick market area her home.

The Grace Family Church and Denis Hurley Centre held a Street Store yesterday, giving the poor and homeless an opportunity to choose a few items of clothing. 

The church received donations of like-new clothing, shoes and accessories for all ages, as well as toys for kids.

“This is a very dignified experience because, often when clothing is donated, the person receiving it has no choice in what they get. They are expected to just be grateful for whatever is given to them. With the Street Store, they come in and choose something they like,” said David Richter of the Grace Family Church.

A manicure, foot wash and hot meal were part of the day’s offerings.

Raymond Perrier, director of the Denis Hurley Centre, said they were happy to be part of the initiative and to see many young people give up their time on Youth Day to volunteer.

“This event shows we can all come together for a common good and give a wonderful experience to those who appreciate it,” he said.

The meals were donated by Food for Life Durban Central. Spokesperson Nishana Baboolall said they served 2000 vegetarian meals every month to those in need in the area.

Mhlongo, meanwhile, said she was very happy with her clothing, and having a manicure and foot wash.
