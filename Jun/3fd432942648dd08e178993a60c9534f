Addressing gender bias in society begins with the lessons learnt in childhood.

This theme was at the heart of discussions at a session entitled “Gender Representation in the Age of Social Media” at the 69th WAN-IFRA World News Media Congress and 24th World Editors Forum which began in Durban this week.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The issue, said Mail and Guardian editor Khadija Patel, could not be looked at separately from other social problems such as racism, homophobia and sexism, which were also embedded in society and, hence, social media.

Sensitivity training, she said, needed to begin at schools.

Media, she explained, had the responsibility to be self-examining and interrogate itself and the terms it used, so as not to deepen gender biases in society.

Fellow panellists Irvine Partners' Samantha Perry and Hot Salsa Media’s Viv Quann agreed, saying that, as advertising professionals, the industry had a valuable role in shaping perceptions in society.

Quann said that depictions of masculinity and femininity needed to be taken into consideration in advertising campaigns.

Discussion moderator Google South Africa’s Mich Atagana said talking about gender bias could not just involve women and that a diversity of voices was needed.

The discussion was well-received by delegates, who took to social media to share their impressions:
