The City of Johannesburg believes the R1.94billion civil damages claim against it is “without merit”.
Makhudu Sefara, the group head of communications at the City of Johannesburg, confirmed that the city had received a claim of R1.9bn from Bill Kirk, who was a member of an unsuccessful bidding consortium for a tender advertised in the early 2000s.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The city and its entity, the Johannesburg Property Company, have filed a notice to defend the matter as we are of the opinion that the claim is without merit. The city has no knowledge of the criminal case that has been opened. However, the law enforcement agencies must perform their duties without fear or favour,” he said.

Sefara added that Kirk had taken this matter to the Scorpions before its disbandment, the former Public Protector, the Hawks and other institutions, which investigated this matter over a period of no less than 12 years without any success.

“The city will vehemently defend itself against what appears, at least to us, a vexatious attempt,” he said.
