A group of KwaZulu-Natal women has made it its mission to put smiles on the faces of young Muslim children during Ramadan. The 300 women who call themselves the Caring Sisters Network (or CSN) this year distributed 2 134 hampers to children all over the province.The organisation said in a statement as Muslims around the world got ready to celebrate Eid al-Fitr on Monday that the Eid Smile Gift Campaign was a project that had begun informally in 2006 by a mother and her four children as a kind gesture to a group of 25 children in a KwaMashu madressa (religious school).The family gave the children new clothing, among other treats.In 2008, a few friends and children joined and the gesture was extended to two of these schools.&nbsp; Back then when numbers were small, gifts were personalised with names, gender and ages. As numbers grew and more sponsors came on board, the idea was born, to increase the number of items and keep the gifts standard. It grew from 25 in 2006 to 80 in 2008, to 240 in 2010, to 680 in 2015, to 1 358 in 2016, to 2 134 this year. The drive this year included 48 orphanages, including those in Ladysmith to Umzinto on the South Coast and up to Canelands on the North Coast.Each gift consists of a blanket and a sports bag filled with essentials and treats.&nbsp;The items fall under the categories of bare essentials (porridge, soups, noodles, peanut butter and an energy drink); warm clothing (a beanie, scarf, ear muffs, socks and cap); towels; stationery; plastic ware (plate, mug, bowl, lunchbox and juice bottle); toiletries; and sweets.Every item is new and is sponsored and donated by members of the network.The Mercury
