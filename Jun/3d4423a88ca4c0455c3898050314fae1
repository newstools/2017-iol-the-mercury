This was a discussion at the World News Media Congress which draws to a close later on Friday at the Durban ICC.
Pontsho Pilane of the Mail and Guardian's Bhekisisa wing, said one of the ways in which they had tried to buck the trend was to do journalism which in most instances led to advocacy. 
She spoke of the Vimba App which is an app designed to link victims of abuse with local NGOs as one of the success stories.
Catherine Gicheru said readers respond positively to information and tools that are helpful to them. She made an example of the Dodgy Doctors tool which helps Kenyans verify if a doctor is legitimate or not. 
This was a response to a number of people masquerading as doctors.
David Lamayaian, the lead developer at Code for Africa in Kenya said editors should lead the content and how it should be shaped. He said editors should explore some of the of the technologies available out there. While this may seem expensive, it is not as open source technologies are available for free, he said. 
"Get your developers out of the basement [and] into the newsroom," said Lamayaian.
William Bird, director of Media Monitoring Africa, said one of the ways to get young audiences is by giving them content that interests them.
Verashni Pillay, former editor of Huffington Post SA, said one of the main problems why audiences were not growing is that various media houses target the same audience.
