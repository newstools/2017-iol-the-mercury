The Mercury on Tuesday, via its Facebook and Twitter accounts, put out a call to those in Durban – who either still lived in the city or had since moved away – to share their memories of the night of the Magoo's Bar bombing.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The 1986 incident, as Independent Media has previously reported, killed three people and wounded 73 others on the Durban beachfront in 1986.
The bomb, said reports, was planted by Robert McBride, who was at the time a unit commander of the African National Congress' (ANC) special operations unit under the command of Aboobaker Ismail.
McBride received three death sentences for the bombing but was given a reprieve when the ANC demanded an end to political executions as a precondition to negotiations with the National Party government, almost 10 years ago.
The response to the request from The Mercury was overwhelming, with the post reaching more than 60 000 people as of Wednesday afternoon.
It had also been shared more than 600 times.
