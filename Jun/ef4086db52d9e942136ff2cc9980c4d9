Karan Beef the premier supplier of the highest quality beef and beef products available in South Africa was paid a visit by the competition commission on allegations of price fixing within the beef industry. The competition commission arrived at their head office on Wednesday to start their investigation.
 
The supplier that was established in 1974 and has committed themselves to the long-term sustainability of the industry has always taken pride in their business that they say has been built on fair and ethical business practices.

However, in a statement by Karan Beef they stated that they fully co-operated with the investigation by providing all documents and information that was required and said that they are happy to co-operate with ongoing investigations. Karan Beef CEO, Arnold Pretorius, said: “I am surprised that the Competition Commission initiated this investigation. I don’t believe that there is any collusion to fix prices either in the purchase of weaner calves, or in the sale of our beef products. If anything, Karan Beef is in fierce competition with other producers in the beef industry implicated in this investigation.” The competition commission still has the suppliers respect for protecting consumers.
“I respect the work of the Competition Commission to protect South African consumers, particularly those most vulnerable to food inflation,” Pretorius added.
