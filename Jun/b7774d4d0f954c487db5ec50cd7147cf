Sbusiso Ntombela, Denzil Ndlovu and Thabani Chauca, who usually beg at the intersection of Smiso Nkwanyana (Goble) Road and Masabalala Yengwa (NMR) Avenue, will from Monday be selling copies of The Mercury and the Daily News as part of the #PaperMoney project, co-ordinated by Stuart Talbot of the Denis Hurley Centre.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The project scouted street corners around the Durban CBD for two months looking for people over the age of 18 who did not beg with children.
It was the brainchild of Raymond Perrier, the director of the Denis Hurley Centre, which works a lot with the homeless.
The Mercury visited several intersections during peak-hour traffic where the sellers, in the bright green vests, kicked off the pilot project.
The #PaperMoney vendors will be selling copies at R10 each with R5 from each sale being kept by the vendors. The initiative, which is being managed by the Denis Hurley Centre in conjunction with Independent Media and Urban Lime, is trying to give Durbanâ€™s homeless a "hand up instead of a hand-out". 
Look out for more on this initiative, both online and in print.
