The South African Teachers Union has called for the immediate suspension of an employee suspected of defrauding the state by pocketing payouts meant for families of deceased colleagues. Sadtu in KwaZulu-Natal yesterday issued a statement unveiling the alleged corruption and fraud by Department of Education employees in the Umzinyathi district. “During the bilateral meeting that we had on the 23rd of June we discovered ...an employee working in the pension section who is defrauding the state by adding unknown beneficiaries when families of deceased employees are making pension claims from the GEPF (Government Employees Pension Fund),” read the statement. Provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said she had personally alerted the department about their findings. “We want the department to do a full investigation because this employee - whose name we have - was not working alone. The employee and other admin staff working in this scam, should be suspended pending the investigation,” she said. Sadtu claimed the department management in the area was aware of the scam but had turned a blind eye merely redeploying the employee to another section in the same district.“Sadtu has always argued that the department does have money...we discovered that employees easily lie with travelling claims which they are not entitled to... Sadtu demands that action be taken and an investigation be done to root out corruption and fraud in the district,” read the statement. Department spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they would look into the allegations. “Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana does not condone any form of corruption of fraud, he believes in good governance. This is a crime and we will dig deep to determine exactly what is happening.”
