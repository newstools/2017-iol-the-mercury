Many donned brightly-coloured ensembles, and others channelled their inner “shero” by dressing as their favourite superheroes, embracing this year’s race theme.
This year, said organisers, changed venue to the Growthpoint Kings Park outer fields, which allowed competitors to run along the beachfront. 
“Here participants can soak in the beautiful views of the city and the long sandy beaches set against exquisite blue winter skies.”
They said: “Dubbed the country’s most beautiful race, the competition now celebrating its 26th year, offers an exciting sporting event for women and girls from nine years up. 
Of course, support from male colleagues, friends and family is always welcome.”
Many competitors took to social media to share their snaps, using the hashtag #SHEroes and #SparRun031.
Some opted to make the race a family day, and brought along their young children in strollers.
