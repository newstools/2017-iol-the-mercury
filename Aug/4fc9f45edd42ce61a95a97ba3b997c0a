East Coast Radio reported that snow had fallen in Nottingham Road and in the Mooi River area on Thursday morning, but it was short-lived as rain had started falling, ending the snowfall.

Snow Report SA said in an interview on eNCA this morning that about 30-40cm of snow was predicted today in the Sani Pass area. Low cloud was moving in and conditions seemed perfect for significant snowfall.

There were also reports of snowfall in Impendle, Lower Lotheni and on the road between Swartberg and Underberg in the Southern Berg.

Traffic officials have urged motorists to take extra care in slippery traffic conditions. At 11am the N3 Toll Concession tweeted that the N3 was free of snow.

Numerous KZN beaches are closed due to heavy surf conditions; the KZN Sharks Board said some beaches in Durban, Salt Rock and Margate Main Beach would stay open for now.

However this was dependent on the lifeguards who would make appropriate decisions depending on the prevailing surf conditions.
