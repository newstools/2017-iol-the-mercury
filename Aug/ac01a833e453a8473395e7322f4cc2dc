A shocking video of a schoolgirl being violently assaulted by a male schoolmate, at what is believed to be a KwaZulu-Natal school, has surfaced on social media.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
In the video, the boy throws the girl against the wall. She falls to the ground and he kicks her repeatedly, before walking away.
The girl struggles to get up.
She appears to be bleeding.
The two looked to be in high school.
They were both wearing school uniforms in the video and it appeared to have been filmed on school premises.
When it was filmed and the name of the school – thought to be in Zululand – was not immediately clear.
But the video, which surfaced on Twitter on Women's Day, has drawn strong reaction from the public.

"Nang' umakoti" wrote on the social networking platform: "So many questions. How are people raising such angry children? What must that girls parents say? The silence of bystanders? Normal much?"
Phiwokuhle Nogwaza wrote: "Absolutely shattered and heartbroken by this".
The spokesperson for the Department of Basic Education in KZN, Muzi Mahlambi, was horrified at the video.
"We are incredibly disturbed at the brutality of this attack," he said.
He said investigations were underway and that once the school and the culprit had been identified, that decisive action would be taken.
"We are going to teach this boy a lesson he will never forget," he said.
