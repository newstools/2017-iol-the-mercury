South African Breweries (SAB) has, in partnership with The Mercury, made a generous donation to three worthy charities that are working towards arresting gender-based violence and empowering women in KwaZulu-Natal.This was announced at The Mercury SAB Women’s Day Lunch, held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre, in Durban, yesterday.“Thanks to our R100 000 sponsorship from SAB, we are able to sponsor three charities that actually say ‘no’ to gender based violence and empower women,” The Mercury’s editor, Yogas Nair, said at the lunch.The first of these was the African Green Revolution (AGR), which received R50 000.Nair emphasised the organisation’s focus on empowering women.Through AGR, Durban designer Michelle Markram creates vertical and rooftop gardens, transforms waste matter into artwork, educates people about a sustainable ethos and working with and not against the environment.The St Michael’s Women’s Hostel in Sydenham received R25 000.“The hostel deals with abused women and children and the homeless,” Nair said yesterday.The third beneficiary, The Mercury Hibberdene Children’s Holiday Home also received R25 000.The Mercury Hibberdene Children’s Holiday Home hosts more than 1 000 underprivileged children every year.The children, many of whom have never slept in their own bed or enjoyed three square meals in one day, get the chance to have a seaside holiday.SAB corporate affairs director for South Africa, Shobna Persadh, said the the group had given The Mercury the opportunity to select the beneficiaries and that she was so pleased with the choices.“The work that they do really gets to the core of helping women,” she said.Later this year, SAB’s Carling Black Label will kick off a campaign aimed at combating violence against women.While she did not want to give away too much yesterday, Persadh said the campaign was “fabulous” and the brainchild of brand director, Samori Gambrah.“We have consulted at length, in terms of research on the statistics of this issue,” she said, “And we are working with the Gender Commission, for their position and what they would like to see happen, especially with addressing men who drink Carling Black Label”.
