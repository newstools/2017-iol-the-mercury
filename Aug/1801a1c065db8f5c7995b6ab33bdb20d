“Her mother who had heard about the incident, went to his residence and found him.”
She rallied the community to help apprehend him, despite his fleeing of the scene.
 “He was handed over to the police and a case of rape was opened for further investigation. 
(He) was charged accordingly and appeared several times in the uMlazi court until he was convicted.”
The uMlazi Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit had been instrumental in cracking the case.
KwaZulu-Natal acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the heavy sentence handed down, especially during Women’s Month. 
“I also thank the community members who stood up and fought child abuse in the area by apprehending the accused and handing him over to the police. 
Victims of abuse must break the silence and report such crimes. They must not be intimidated by any criminals.”
