The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal is investigating the situation at Richards Bay Secondary School, on the province’s North Coast. This comes after a violent panga brawl there was caught on video last week. On Monday, a high level delegation from the department visited the school. Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said that during their visit, various issues emerged.“There are also allegations of racism, drug peddling and lawlessness and a lack of order at the school,” he said. “The MEC has said that if any teacher is found to have done anything wrong, he will not hesitate to take action against him or her. Even if that means suspension or dismissal. And if a pupil is found to have done something, we will take action against that pupil”.The brawl took place on Friday and it was apparently because of a minor row about opening a schoolbus window.The MEC, Mthandeni Dlungwana, addressed pupils at the school yesterday.He took a hard line with them.“If you think you are special, we can assure you that you are not,” he said.He said violence would not be tolerated on school premises.The MEC also spoke about the importance of discipline and the dangers of drugs, alcohol and teenage pregnancy .Afterwards, he spoke with the school management team, the school governing body and union representatives.
