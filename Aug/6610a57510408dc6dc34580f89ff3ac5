The Zulu Warriors departed from King Shaka International Airport on Tuesday to attend the 135th King Cetshwayo Celebrations in Cardiff, Wales in the UK where they will be accompanied by a wider cast and the Zulu Royal Choir to participate in the re-enactment of the Battle of Isandlwana.  Their participation in the King Cetshwayo Celebrations there will strengthen cultural ties between KwaZulu-Natal and the UK. The celebrations are a prelude to the 140th commemoration of the Battle of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift in January 2019 and a campaign to market the province to the UK.

LISTEN: Zulu warriors depart to Cardiff, UKInterview with CEO of the KZN Arts and Culture Trust Gugu KaMavundla Ngcobo.In November 2011, King Goodwill KaBhekuZulu hosted Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.Premier Willies Mchunu commented yesterday: “Every year we welcome visitors from the UK and all over the world to the old Kingdom of the Zulu people. We want to increase the number of tourists who will attend the commemoration of the battle of Isandlwana next year, especially those from the UK.”Mchunu further emphasised: “Our participation in the celebrations in the UK should be viewed within the context of social cohesion. When we voted on the 27th April 1994 it meant the tensions and conflict that we carried as South Africans over many decades was finally settled. We have created platforms for all communities to accept each other as equals. This was done through the national general elections based on equality and the principle of one man one vote. “As we move forward as one nation united in diversity, we have to build an inclusive economy which creates jobs but more importantly an economy that reflects the demographics of the country. We need to harness the cooperation of business in private-public partnerships for nation building and to enhance economic development, tourism and job creation in our province.”
