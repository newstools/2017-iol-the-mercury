Meditech ER paramedics responded to the call when Loki, the eleven-month-old pup, sustained the injury.

They said via their Facebook page that the service’s owner Michelle Smith received a “lick of gratitude and love” when she paid the dog a visit at Westville Veterinary Hospital on Saturday.

The paramedics responded to the “unusual call” on Thursday last week.

They said they hurried to transfer the dog from the Winston Park Vet, where it had been stabilised, to the Westville Veterinary Hospital.

“The dog needed to be assessed at the hospital after the incident,” she told The Mercury on Sunday.

The pitbull, she said, weighed approximately 26kg and had been bleeding profusely.

“Loki was extremely uncomfortable and had been injured quite severely.”

The dog, she said, would have to be brought back to the hospital for secondary assessments.
