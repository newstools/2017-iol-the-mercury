Wayde van Niekerk is willing to fight for the right to be named the heir apparent to Usain Bolt’s throne as the IAAF World Championships starting in London tomorrow (on Friday) represents the changing of the guard. The build-up to the global showpiece has seen two of its two biggest drawcards exchange compliments as the one paid homage to the retiring hero and the other admired the rise of a star.Speaking at an Adidas sponsorships event, Van Niekerk told journalists of his appreciation for what Bolt has done for the sport but also of his desire to become king. “It’s one thing someone saying he can be the next great thing but it’s another thing working for that greatness,” Van Niekerk said.“This is a dream that I need to fight for and I need to fight for it as hard as I can.”On Tuesday evening Bolt once again singled out Van Niekerk as one of the athletes to become the new poster child of the sport.“He told me he’ll send my invoice because he’s been putting me out there quite a lot,” Van Niekerk said about their relationship in recent times.“It’s an honour to be able to learn and rub shoulders with a great like Usain.”The South African world record-holder was on the cusp of reaching his own level of greatness targeting a rare 200-400m double gold at the championships.Asked whether he had spoken to Bolt about the pressure of being the face of the sport, Van Niekerk said he had an acute awareness of the task ahead.“His impact on the sport has been massive and now I’m having the opportunity to build a small relationship with him and I continue my journey,” Van Niekerk said.The defending 400m world champion said while he had no immediate plans to remove the one-lap sprint from his repertoire, the shorter distances would receive more attention in future.“The 400m is a very difficult topic for me, it brought me to where I am today so I will be stupid to let it go and let it slip,” Van Niekerk said.“But at the same time I wish I could have left it and focused on the 100m and the 200m but I didn't think I would just because of the fact that I am doing so great in the event."
