Melbourne: A 16-year-old Australian boy’s family were left baffled when he returned from the beach bleeding, and all efforts to stem the bleeding failed.Sam Kanizay had gone to Dendy Street Beach in Brighton, Melbourne to cool down after a game of football and went for a swim.He said that he felt a tingling sensation but had no idea of the horror that was to follow.“I wasn’t really thinking about being eaten,” he told ABC News.When he came out of the water after about half an hour, he saw his legs were covered in blood.He said: “I walked out of the water, saw what I thought was sand covering my ankles and lower calf so I just shook it off violently and it came off.”By the time he had walked across the sand to put his clothes on he looked down and noticed he had blood all over his ankles and feet.“I didn't really know what to think of it, it was a bit of a shock."When he got home, his father, Jarrod, was taken aback.“My dad gave me this funny stare and I gave him a stare because we both just had no clue what was going on,” Sam said.His father could not stop the heavy bleeding, which came from small holes on the lower part of his leg, and took his son to hospital.He was given antibiotics, and later taken to a different hospital, but his legs continued to bleed into the early hours of Sunday.University of New South Wales marine invertebrates expert, Alistair Poore, said he had never seen a case like it, The Guardian reported.Poore told Guardian Australia the biting must have been caused by a marine invertebrate, most likely sea lice. But he said a large number of sea lice would be needed to cause such extensive bleeding.“If it is sea lice, then it is a pretty dramatic example of it,” Poore said. He said often beachgoers mistook stinging from the remnants of jellyfish tentacles with bites. But he said the bleeding in this case appeared too severe for that scenario.According to experts at the Museums Victoria, sea lice are “active at night when they swim, they can reduce a dead fish to a skeleton in a few hours. Although usually resting buried in sand they are active swimmers when searching for food.”Sam is expected to make a full recovery without any permanent scarring.“I’d hate to see anyone else going through this. If we can prevent it for anyone else, that’s the aim of us talking to people," Sam’s mother, Jane Kanizay said. - The Independent
