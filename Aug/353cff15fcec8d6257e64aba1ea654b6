On Saturday night, an oil truck driver, believed to be in his 40s, sustained minor injuries on the N3 between Mooi River and Nottingham Road at approximately 10pm.
ER24 medical services spokesperson Annine Siddall said in a statement the driver lost control of the truck and crashed into an open field.
“At the time of their arrival, paramedics found the driver outside of the burning truck.”
The man, said Siddall, had been treated for a wound to his hand.
He did not want to be transported to hospital.
Also on Saturday night, six people were injured in an accident in Chatsworth.
