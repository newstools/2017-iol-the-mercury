This is where the North Beach Parkrun – which starts and ends at Suncoast – comes in.
Organisers of the weekly event – held every Saturday at 8am – said in a statement that the event involved runners from over 15 countries across five continents, and was founded by Paul Sinton-Hewitt in 2004 and was originally called the Bushy Park Time Trial. 
“Come take part in one of the biggest Parkruns in the world right in your own backyard. It’s a timed 5km fun run that’s suitable for the entire family, from first time runners to experienced runners.”
The North Beach Parkrun is currently the biggest in South Africa with over 32 000 registered runners. 
“On any given Saturday over 50 volunteers prep the Suncoast SUNdeck and Amphitheatre for a turnout of over 1 000 runners of all different ages.”
Marketing manager for the casino Louise Howell said that their amphitheatre already saw a strong community of runners, cyclists, joggers, speed walkers and walkers, so to have an additional 1 000 to 2 000 runners brought a “great energy” to the complex.
