A young penguin is receiving treatment after it was found sick on a KwaZulu-Natal beach.

The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) said via its Facebook page that it was treating Haviana, the feisty juvenile African penguin who was admitted into the uShaka Sea World hospital last week and given rehydration fluids immediately.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 “Haviana, weighing 1.5kg, had an old, healed shark bite wound on his back and x-rays confirmed no breaks or muscle damage which is good news. A blood smear found Haviana to have malaria, so the necessary treatment has commenced.”

They said the penguin had started eating sardine tails and was slowing gaining strength.

According to conservation experts, eighteen penguin species have been recorded globally and have been found to occur only in the southern hemisphere, with the most notable in Southern Africa, being the African Penguin.

The species (Spheniscus demersus), they said, was Africa’s only extant (surviving) penguin and was also endemic as a breeding species to both South Africa and Namibia.

 “This seabird was once South Africa’s most abundant seabird with pairs of over 1 million in the 1910s to present population recorded to less than 25 000 pairs globally. This led to the status of the African Penguin being re-assessed according to the International Union for Conservation for Nature (IUCN) criteria in 2010 where it was up-listed from vulnerable to endangered.”
