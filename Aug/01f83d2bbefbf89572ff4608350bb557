The incident took place during the Kloof Conservancy's 3 Falls Trail Run, which began at Forest View Primary School, and included both an 18.6km run and a 5km fun run.
The runner had lost her footing and fractured her ankle. Blue Security's community and media liaison officer for Durban, Andreas Mathios, said volunteer rescue group Rescuetech Search and Rescue, emergency medical services Meditech ER and emergency communications body #Hamnet all responded to the call.
Rescuetech’s Peter Koekemoer said they had received the call and responded immediately.
“The patient was examined and carried out of the area in which she fell. She was taken to hospital.”
Hamnet’s Keith Lowes said he had been assisting with the emergency communication for the race.
“This is the fourth year that we've been at the race. Ankle injuries are common because of the terrain. Two other runners also suffered ankle  injuries.”
