Special Olympics South Africa said in a statement this week that Dr Mathews Phosa, a number of sporting legends, celebrities and business executives were taking the plunge later this month to support the cause.

The annual event began in the USA and had been supported by Lady Gaga, Jimmy Fallon and Vince Vaughn, among many others.

Organisers in that country said on their website that the event was “much more than just an icy dip in the water”.

“Our goal is to create a world where every single person is accepted and welcomed. We are helping to make the world a better, healthier, and more joyful place—one athlete, one volunteer, one family member, one plunger at a time.

Special Olympics South Africa said that in the local event plungers would dive into the frigid waters of the King David Linksfield swimming pool in Johannesburg on August 27.
