“The numerous weather and swell forecasting models that the Board monitors are all predicting unsettled seas and a strong groundswell of up to 3m.

These unsettled seas and large swells could result in the movement or damage to shark safety gear should it remain in the water. In order to minimise damage or losses the Sharks Board, in consultation with the affected Municipalities, has this morning removed shark safety gear at the majority of protected bathing beaches.”

 Head of operations Mike Anderson-Reade said the shark safety gear would be replaced as soon as the seas had settled.

“We are confident that the gear will remain stable.”
