The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) is considering requests from the poultry industry to import fertilised eggs to close the gap left by culled birds.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
This request was made after 24 cases of avian flu (also known as bird flu) were detected in the country since June this year.
A commercial layer farm in the KwaZulu-Natal town of Vryheid also had to put down some of its birds last week.

Minister Senzeni Zokwana said in a media briefing in Cape Town on Wednesday that the department was conducting a thorough risk assessment in order to avoid exposing the country to other disease risks. 
“The first option is for the risk mitigation to be conducted in South Africa through stringent quarantine measures on arrival of the hatching eggs from their country of origin.
The second option will be for stringent quarantine measures in the country of origin where the eggs will come from compartments free of specified diseases that the department will approve, with less stringent post arrival quarantine measures.”
Zokwana said the requests could only be considered for imports from avian influenza-free countries as well as those which South Africa currently imported from.
He said negotiations with international trade partners were ongoing to ensure a continuation of trade from disease-free compartments with special biosecurity measures as well as the export of fresh ostrich meat from a closed holding.
