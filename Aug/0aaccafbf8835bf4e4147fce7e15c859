The KwaZulu-Natal department of Labour said in a recent statement that, in “their constant efforts to improving the lives of vulnerable workers”, the national minister Mildred Oliphant and eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede would be hosting the imbizo with domestic workers to educate them on labour-related matters.
Oliphant was also set to engage the workers on the national minimum wage which was to be implemented from May 2018, and on legislation such as Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act and others.
In February, the minimum wage was set at R20 per hour, effective from May 1, 2018.
Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said in February this year that the national minimum wage agreement would translate into R3 500 a month for people working 40 hours a week and R3 900 for those working 45 hours a week.
The department said that the event would also be used to celebrate Women’s Month.
“The minister and mayor will be accompanied by senior management from the department and the city to engage in robust discussions with the 1 500 workers that are expected to attend.”
The meeting – where various stakeholders would also exhibit their services to delegates – was set to take place at the Durban City Hall at 8.30am.
