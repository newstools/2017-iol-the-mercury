The Mercury reported on Monday that one of the three people arrested walked into the Estcourt police station on Friday night, told the officers on duty that he was “tired of eating human flesh” and subsequently produced part of a human leg and a hand.
The ANC said in a statement that they were “deeply disturbed” by the events.
“(We) would like to pass our condolences to the families, friends and communities that have lost their loved ones in such a brutal manner.”
They said they had first learnt of the disturbing turn of events through media reports, but were trying to understand what had happened before issuing a statement.
“We are angered and surprised that any (person) would do to another human what the accused have allegedly done to the deceased.”
They said they would continue to fight crime, working hand in hand with the institutions “created by our people for safety, security and justice”. 
“This also (emphasises) the important role of structures such as CPF and neighbourhood watches in ensuring that such activities are quickly identified and reported to the relevant institutions for speedy actions.”
