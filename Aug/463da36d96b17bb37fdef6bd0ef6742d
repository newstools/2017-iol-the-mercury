Teaching and learning returned to normal at the George Campbell Technical High School in Durban on Wednesday after disruptions over the past few days.Teachers did not arrive at the school on Monday and refused to teach on Tuesday, demanding that the “instigator” of recent unrest at the Durban school be removed from the classroom.Last week, pupils protested against various issues, including racism. They claimed they had been victimised and called “monkeys” and the K-word.Their claims were corroborated by several members of the school community.Department of Education spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa said on Sunday that the department had resolved to suspend two employees. Teachers’ union Naptosa said this week that members had been unhappy that the pupil who allegedly instigated the unrest was still at school. The safety of pupils and educators were a concern, the unions said.Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said on Tuesday that teachers were told that a protest would be unprotected and dismissible, and that they would have to wait for an interim investigation report before any action would be taken against pupils.
