Sivuyile Mfunelwa is ready for the biggest challenge of his coaching career yet.
In the space of just two years the 23-year-old who hails from Khayelitsha in the Western Cape has established himself as one of the top coaches at the Gary Kirsten Foundation.
 Now he is all set for a whirlwind three-month coaching assignment on the beautiful island of Mauritius.
The project is a continuation of the work done to develop and promote further interest on the island by Gary Kirsten Cricket from 2016 and will see Mfunelwa based at the Northfields Cricket Club. 
“It is an amazing opportunity for me,” said Mfunelwa who will be travelling overseas for the first time.
“I am so grateful to Gary Kirsten Cricket and the foundation for the positive difference they have made in my life. They took me from the township and introduced me to the world.”
Mfunelwa was identified by Gary Kirsten Cricket in 2015 and currently manages the foundation's township cricket ecosystems at Chris Hani, Siphamandla, Impendulo, Sivile and Masiphelele Primary Schools.
“I never imagined that my career would shift towards cricket and that I would be fortunate enough to work with the team. Two years ago I was working in sales and marketing hoping that one day I would get the chance to coach youngsters,” he said.
The foundation’s coaching director Ryan Van Niekerk said Mfunelwa would be a great asset to the club and the overall development of cricket on the island.
