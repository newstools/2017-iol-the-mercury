This centre was established in 1947 and was once a SANDF base.
It accommodates 36 women and 35 men.
Women in enforcement, including Provincial Officer Mbali Maphanga (Provincial Inspector in Pietermaritzburg) and Zinhle Mngomezulu (Provincial Traffic Information Officer) spearheaded the programme.
“We chose this centre because it is not around town and most homes in rural areas are not paid attention to,” said Mngomezulu.
During the visit, the officers handed over gifts which included lunch, pillows, sofas, plates and cups, diapers, wheelchairs, cold drinks and wet wipes. 
Emuseni Matron NE Dlamini said: “I am very happy that the Department of Transport chose to come celebrate this day with us, and we are very thankful for the gifts that they have brought along”. 
One of the centre’s residents Gogo Roseline Cele expressed her gratitude for the visit.
“We want to thank you for all the gifts that were donated to us. It will really go a long way. To receive some love on this Women’s Day is special because some of us do not even get visitors. We are very grateful.”
