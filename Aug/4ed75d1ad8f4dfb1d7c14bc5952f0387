The event – organised by the South African Jazz Appreciators Association (SAJAA) in association with iTheku Regional Jazz Association (iTReJA) – was a celebration of  female artists in the industry.
It was held at the N-Shed at the Port of Durban on Saturday night and the line-up included Chantal Willie-Petersen, Xolisa Dlamini, Spha Mdlalose, Lindiwe Maxolo, Nomfundo Xaluva, NUZ comtech, Njabulo Nzuza and Feya Faku.
“(Our) vision is host to an annual festival in Durban during Women’s Month, to be dominated by female artists. This year it will be the first ever jazz festival to commemorate and celebrate women in jazz artists.”
Organisers said on their website that the main goal was to inculcate youth participation in jazz in order to unearth hidden talent, while channelling the talented girl child towards the jazz genre.
“But more importantly (they must be encouraged to) channel their energy in the right direction in order to address societal challenges gripping the country at the moment. (We want) the festival to develop women and girl child activists and ambassadors on women and children issues.”
