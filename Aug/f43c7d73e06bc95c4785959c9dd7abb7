Department spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi told The Mercury on Thursday afternoon that these challenges had “regrettably” affected certain areas of the hospital. 
He said: “The generator kicked in but the problem persisted. Engineers are on-site.” 
Whilst the matter was being attended to, said Mkhwanazi, emergency patients were being re-routed to sister health facilities within Durban. 
“The department would like to apologise to the public in general and to clients in particular.”
Patients using the hospital, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted The Mercury on Thursday with their concerns.
“The hospital has been without power for the past day (Wednesday), with still no power today (Thursday). 
The patient was concerned about others who relied on the hospital for their care.
The hospital came under scrutiny last month when the DA was set to do oversight visits there but were denied access to the medical facility.
 The visit was related to the ongoing oncology crisis in KwaZulu-Natal.
