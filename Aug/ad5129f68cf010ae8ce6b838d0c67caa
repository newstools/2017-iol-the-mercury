Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the 25-year-old man had been arrested at a relative's home in Izingolweni, in Port Shepstone. He had fled there after five others were arrested following a chilling confession by traditional healer Nino Mbatha, that he was tired of eating human flesh, with body part in hand. 
After handing himself over to Estcourt police almost two weeks ago, another traditional healer Sithembiso Sithole was arrested with co-accused Lindokuhle Masondo, Lungisani Magubane and Khayelihle Lamula.

The five men abandoned bail at the Estcourt Magistrates Court on Monday, where they appeared briefly before being whisked away from a waiting crowd of picketers by police. 
Mbele said the man was captured by Izingolweni police after information was received that he had been hiding in the area. 
He was transported to appear in the same court on Thursday. He is also facing charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 
More arrests were imminent, said Mbele.
