Police officers in south Durban on Monday evening were involved in a shootout with robbers after a businessman was held up and had been shot. Responding police officers fatally wounded one of the suspects. Police spokesperson Colonel Thulani Zwane said the businessman and his brother were at a shop on Nomzamo Mandel Road, Welbedacht East at about 6.30pm, when they were approached by seven armed suspects. They were allegedly held up at gunpoint and robbed of cash and airtime vouchers from the shop.  Zwane said police were alerted and immediately responded. The suspects shot the businessman in the chest and also opened fire on police who returned fire, fatally wounding one suspect.  “The other suspects managed to flee and the Durban Flying Squad as well as the Durban K9 Unit responded and began searching for the suspects.” Zwane said community members helped police during the operation and two suspects were found hiding in a nearby house. They were arrested. One of them had been shot during the shootout. He was taken to hospital and is under police guard.  Four suspects are still at large and police are continuing with the search for them.  Zwane said a case of robbery and attempted murder was opened at Chatsworth police station. The two suspects arrested are 17 and 19 years old. They will appear in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court soon. KZN Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, praised police officers who yesterday were “brave enough to face the barrel of the gun when confronted with criminals”.  “Our members were able to survive by using their skills and tactics during the shootout with the criminals in Chatsworth. We have previously warned criminals not to shoot at our police officers but to rather surrender to police when they are approached. Our officers have been trained to defend themselves when attacked by criminals,” he said. “Our detectives will work around the clock in tracing those still at large.”
