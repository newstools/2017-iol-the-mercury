We’ve all heard dire warnings of the consequences if climate change mitigation targets are not met. Rising temperatures are set to take a human toll and now there are warnings that soaring temperatures, and heat waves in particular, will start to claim tens of thousands of lives a year in Europe this century.The Guardian website, referencing research published in the respected journal Lancet Planetary Health, reported that deaths from weather disasters could increase 50-fold in Europe by the start of the next century if no action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or protect citizens. A study  co-authored by Giovanni Forzieri, from the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Italy, estimates a toll of 152 000 deaths a year between 2071 and 2100 as a direct result of hazards relating to extreme weather. The website Malta Independent, referencing the same research, reported that as temperatures continued to rise over the next 54 years, up to 350 people a year would die on the tiny island. Those living in southern Europe were likely to be the hardest hit by the changes.“Almost everyone living in Malta, Italy, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia would be affected by such weather-related disasters, causing 700 deaths per million people annually. This compares with the current 11 deaths per million people, researchers found,” Malta Independent reported.Forzieri pointed out that the analysis in the study did not take into account indirect effects on public health, warning that problems from cardiovascular disease to mental health disorders could become more prevalent.Research onlineParts of Southern and Eastern Europe are currently in the midst of a punishing heat wave that has claimed at least two lives.“Lucifer” is stifling Serbia, Romania, Croatia and parts of Spain, France and Italy. There has has been significant crop damage and wildfires.
