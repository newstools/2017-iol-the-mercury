Trafford Ngcamu’s sentence from the Durban Regional court this week, said police in a statement on Thursday, also included a further ten years in prison on the kidnapping charges.

The 31-year-old committed the crimes in Imfume in January 2015. 

“A then 14-year-old (girl) was on her way home when she met Ngcamu who forced her into a minibus taxi without saying a word. 

He took her into a house at Imfume Mission where he repeatedly raped her until the next day. He released her and threatened to kill her if she mentioned her ordeal to anyone.”

Police said the victim had reported the incident and a case of rape was opened at Amanzimtoti police station. 

“It was transferred to Umlazi Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. The investigating officer immediately arrested Ngcamu and took him to court to face the full might of law for his dreadful acts.”

 He had been kept in custody until his conviction. 

“Ngcamu’s actions proved that he does not deserve to be within the community and he had to be sent where he must re-look his actions and be rehabilitated. 

Abuse of women and children cannot be tolerated in our communities and we will fight gender-based violence tooth and nail,” said the KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa.
