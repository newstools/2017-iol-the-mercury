Durban - A diver from the KZN South Coast who pleaded guilty to charges related to his involvement in an international child pornography ring on Tuesday, says he suffers from mental health issues. The man appeared in the Port Shepstone Regional Court, where he pleaded guilty to being in possession of 277 images of child pornography, sexually assaulting his 5-year-old daughter and using the girl to create illicit material. He cannot be named, to protect her identity. In his plea statement, the man said he suffered from “at least four recognisable mental disorders,” including an antisocial personality disorder, a substance abuse disorder, paedophilia and a dependent personality disorder. He wanted this to be taken into account during sentencing. He also emphasised that he did not penetrate his daughter. “I plead that I never inserted any part of my body - and in particular not my fingers - into her vaginal cavity,” he said, “I plead that my child was not harmed physically at all.” In respect of his using the child to make child pornography, he admitted that “although the child did not resist, her actions did not amount to consent”. Police officers from the newly formed serial and electronic crimes investigation unit - operating within the Family Violence, Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Unit - arrested the man in June, after police in the UK arrested a man there on similar charges and linked the two.He was subsequently linked to other suspects in Australia and the US. It is believed they were communicating via social media.After he was arrested, the man’s former partner - a woman from South-East Asia - returned to her home country with their children.His bail has been extended until sentencing in November.The Mercury
