The survey of 1 001 South African women between 18 and 39 found that just under 70% of those who straighten their hair and almost 50% with braids say they are experiencing thinning or abnormal hair loss.

The research by Insight Survey on behalf of Plantur 21 caffeine shampoo which protects against hair loss in young women, showed that 60% of black respondents had braids or hair extensions while an average 60% of all respondents straightened their hair – the highest percentage (69%) in KwaZulu-Natal.

Among the total sample surveyed, 43% of all respondents, including those who did not straighten their hair or have braids, reported thinning or abnormal hair loss.

A previous survey showed this number rose to 50% among women between 46 and 55.

“Emotional stress and imbalanced diets contribute to hair loss, and the physical stress on hair from braids or straightening agents may be an added factor as the survey displays,” said Dr Adolf Klenk, Head of Germany-based Dr Wolff Research.
