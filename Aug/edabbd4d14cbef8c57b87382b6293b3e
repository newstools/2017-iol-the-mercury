The awards, organisers said in a statement, were Africa and the Middle East’s premiere initiative that recognised, rewarded, inspired and fostered creativity in the brand communication industry.

“As the highest accolade for creativity and innovation across our region, the Loeries promotes and supports creativity by helping marketers, agencies and consumers appreciate the value of ideas and fresh thinking.”

Like every year, the awards also presents a variety workshops, one of which being the DStv Seminar of Creativity featuring international guest speakers and global thought leaders followed by the annual awards ceremony showcasing the continent's creative and innovative brand and advertising concepts.

Suhana Gordhan, FCB Africa creative director and chairperson of the event, said it was an opportunity for the creative industry to network, inspire and enjoy each other's company over the week.

"When you attend the Loeries, you always know its going to be big and people are always sharing on social media about how they are preparing for the weekend. It is the one opportunity for the entire industry to descend into one place to meet and have conversations, inspire and have a good time."

The awards ceremony will take place on Saturday and Sunday at the Durban ICC.
