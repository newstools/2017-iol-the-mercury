THE DA in eThekwini yesterday tabled its performance scorecard for the municipality, with Mayor Zandile Gumede scoring just 2 out of 10.The scorecard underscores the “difficult” relationship between Gumede and DA councillors, with the party leaders stating, “they do not trust the mayor”.Gumede's spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede said the scorecard was a pointless exercise meant to steal the mayor's thunder when she delivers a report next week on the progress made so far. The scorecards are part of the party’s assessment of the municipality's performance since the forming of the new council in August last year. Their assessment was negative, with the DA saying eThekwini was on the verge of collapse.“The mayor has scored 2 out of 10, and the 2 is for that she is the mayor, we really could not  find anything that she had done since taking office,” said DA leader in the municipality Zwakele Mncwango.He said Gumede did not engage and prevented opposition parties from debating controversial affairs in the council.“The purchase of the casspirs (armoured security vehicles), dogs, dogs handlers, exodus of officials, service delivery protest marches, failing court cases, increases in cases of corruption are all under her leadership within this period.“The mayor must remember the needs of the people first and not her party,” said  Mncwango.
