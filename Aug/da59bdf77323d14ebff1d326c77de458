EnviroServ workers were also at court... they were protesting against the court action, saying their livelihoods were at risk:

A criminal case against EnviroServ was opened in April. At that stage, however, only the company was being charged.

Residents from the area were at court on Thursday and so were EnviroServ workers. The workers are opposed to the court action.

They say the allegations against EnviroServ are unfounded and that their livelihoods are at risk. The matter is due back in court in November.
