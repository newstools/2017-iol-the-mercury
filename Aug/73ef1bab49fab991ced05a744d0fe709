An attempt to break a world record in Durban on Friday has been postponed because of rainy weather.

The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa was hoping to break the global stargazing record set in Australia in 2015.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In that attempt, 1 868 people gathered to look at the night sky but the Society’s media and PR director Logan Govender expected at least 2 000 in Durban.

 “Hundreds of people from as far afield as Port Edward, Ballito  and Underberg will be disappointed to hear that the eagerly awaited Guinness World Record attempt (this) evening to assemble the largest number of people watching the stars together at a single venue, has had to be postponed due to inclement weather.”

He said the cold front which had been steadily approaching the city was expected to be nudged out to sea but had instead positioned itself over the entire province.

“We would like our usually loyal (members) to have the most comfortable conditions for the event and have decided to postpone until further notice,” he said.
