The suspect, they said, had been accused by the community members of stealing livestock and on one occasion had been rescued by police from irate community members who wanted to set his house on fire.
The suspect was charged for stock theft and appeared on Wednesday at Nsuze Magistrates’ Court. 
“As the investigation continues, it was discovered that the suspect had planned to slaughter the goats for a traditional ceremony. The goats were handed back to the lawful owner after the recovery.”
The suspect had been linked to another stock theft case where a cow had been stolen.
“He will also be profiled if he can be linked to other reported stock theft cases. The cow skin has been positively identified by its owner who had been searching for his stolen cow.”
