Durban Port Manager, Moshe Motlohi, said in a statement: “Over and above this being about the public learning more about our port, it’s also a platform for our local talent to showcase their capabilities. 
It was therefore important for us to ensure that our headline and supporting acts are local artists who are renowned in the industry.”
Durban-born rapper, songwriter and record producer Nasty C released the first single Hell Naw off his debut album Bad Hair Extensions early in 2016.

Amanda Black, who describes her genre of music as “Afro-soul with a fusion of hip-hop and a bit of soul and rhythm and blues”, saw tremendous success with her award-winning hit single Amazulu. It features on her debut studio album Amazulu which was certified platinum three weeks after its release. 
Black also gained widespread public attention as a Top 7 finalist on Season 11 of Idols.
Festival goers can also look forward to being entertained by the likes of DJ Nivaadh, Handsome DJ and Band, Sparks Bantwana and DJ Thukzin over the festival weekend.
Some of the other action lined up so far includes tours of South African Navy ships, tugboat rides, a careers exhibition focusing on maritime vocations, a sailing regatta, sea rescue displays, a special kids’ zone, live music, plus an array of other waterside and landside activities. 
There will also be a craft market and food stalls where goodies can be purchased from local stallholders.
