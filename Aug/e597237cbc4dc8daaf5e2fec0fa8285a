Former US statesman Barack Obama leapt back into the public domain at the weekend with his tweets on the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion… People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love… For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite,” Obama said, quoting former South African president Nelson Mandela in tweets.A woman was killed and others seriously injured this weekend when James Fields drove a vehicle into a group of counter-protesters protesting against a far right, white supremacist rally in the Virginia town.The Mandela quote was split into three tweets, the first of which included a photo of Obama greeting a group of children through a window. It has been retweeted more than 1 million times.The quote came from the 1994 autobiography “Long Walk to Freedom”.The Washington Post, citing Favstar, a Twitter-tracking site, reported that it was one of the most-liked tweets in the history of Twitter. It also ranks No 7 among the most retweeted tweets.CNN said: “The tweet has been liked more than 3 million times, making it the most liked tweet of all time.”
