	WATCH: UKZN VC speaks on the illegal placement of students, reveals 286 staff under investigation. Video: Nabeelah Shaikh 
Earlier this year, three people were arrested and appeared in court when a sting operation led by the Hawks raided their homes. The three, former teacher, Preshni Hiramun, and Little Gujarati owners, Varsha and Hiteshkumar Bhatt, are accused of selling medicine and health science places at the university for upto R500 000. 
They have since been released on bail. 

Meanwhile on Thursday, a sting operation led by a university appointed independent forensic audit team swooped on staff members while students protested for the release of a prior forensic report to be released on the medical school campus.
