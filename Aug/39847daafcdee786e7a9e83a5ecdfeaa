The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said in a statement that they had been activated by the Transnet Ports Authority (TNPA) after the incident, in which a 36-year-old angler was the victim.
NSRI Richards Bay deputy station commander Brynn Gericke said their sea rescue vehicle had been dispatched carrying their rescue swimmers to the scene.
“Two sea rescue craft were towed to the scene to be launched if required. The TNPA helicopter carrying NSRI ASR (Air Sea Rescue) rescue swimmers and Ezemvelo Wildlife rangers and the SA Police Services (also) responded.”
Gericke said a local fishing boat, Advantage, also assisted in the operation and searched an area north of the area.
“Despite an extensive sea, shore and air search and rescue operation no sign of the missing fisherman has been found and a police dive unit will continue an ongoing search operation.
Police have opened an investigation into the incident.”
