Durban Hopes are high in the Midlands that an initiative to revive a heritage steam train line at Hilton could help counter crime.</p> </p> The local steam heritage association has reached an agreement with Transnet after years of waiting to bring stagnant locomotives back to life and renovate the local station.</p> </p> At the same time, the local community policing forum is fed up with the parastatal not clearing overgrowth along six kilometres of track that winds through the town, saying it provides a haven for criminals. </p> </p> The CPF has laid a charge against Transnet, which was on hold as negotiations were in progress but has said it would reinstate the charge if Transnet does not start clean-up work within two weeks, CPF spokesman Radley Keys said this week.</p> </p> He said a charge had initially been laid last month after a family s home near the disused line had experienced four break-ins. Picture: Owen Guy</p> </p> The last involved the robbers using axes to break down a glass door. That s the type of violence that was used, he said.</p> </p> Transnet spokesman Mike Asefovitz said it was unfortunate that the CPF had laid the charge while the parastatal was meeting with the Hilton Steam Heritage Association. </p> </p> We would hope that they withdraw the charge now that we have an agreed process in place. </p> </p> He said the first part of the agreement was that the station precinct would be handed over to Hilton Steam Heritage Association and a local developer on a short-term lease for the urgent and necessary clean-up work and to secure the environment for the longer-term development. </p> </p> Much work still needs to be done, but Transnet and the association and local role players are quite excited about the potential development of the station precinct.</p> </p> A steering committee has been established and will meet every two months to ensure the immediate works are executed timeously as well as to guide the formulation of a long-term development plan for the area, said Asefovitz.</p> </p> Association chairman Grant Fryer said there are presently six locomotives and carriages at the old station, one of which might cost around R100 000 to return to steam . Others would cost more than a million.</p> </p> Vagrants have occupied some of the rolling stock and the Natal Railway Museum on the site has been closed following break-ins.</p> </p> Local Democratic Alliance councillor Craig Millar said that a couple of weeks ago he facilitated a meeting with Transnet.</p> </p> It s quite exciting. It has been a long, hard wait. I have been at pains to remind people over that it was always going to be a marathon, not a sprint. </p> </p> The line through Hilton fell into disuse following floods at nearby Sweetwaters in 1987.</p> </p> The long-term plan is to offer tourist steam train rides, re-open the museum and offer a children's playground and coffee shop.</p> </p> It is, after all, the heart and start of the Midlands Meander, said Fryer.</p> </p> </p> The Mercury </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> The local steam heritage association has reached an agreement with Transnet after years of waiting to bring stagnant locomotives back to life and renovate the local station.</p> </p> At the same time, the local community policing forum is fed up with the parastatal not clearing overgrowth along six kilometres of track that winds through the town, saying it provides a haven for criminals. </p> </p> The CPF has laid a charge against Transnet, which was on hold as negotiations were in progress but has said it would reinstate the charge if Transnet does not start clean-up work within two weeks, CPF spokesman Radley Keys said this week.</p> </p> He said a charge had initially been laid last month after a family s home near the disused line had experienced four break-ins.
