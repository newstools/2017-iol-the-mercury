Durban - The Hawks are circling in on the beleaguered University of Zululand.The specialised crime fighting unit also known as the the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation is now investigating vice-chancellor Professor Xoliswa Mtose and, it is understood, allegations pertaining to fraud and corruption levelled against her last year.Provincial spokesperson for the Hawks, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, this week confirmed to The Mercury that Mtose was under investigation by its Durban Commercial Crime Unit, but he was unable to divulge further details.But former university lecturer Hlakaniphani Jamile confirmed that he had opened a case against the vice-chancellor at the Mtunzini police station in November, and The Mercury understands that the Hawks have now taken over the investigation.The Mercury has seen a statement deposed by Jamile, in which he accuses Mtose of:* Having awarded an irregular private security tender.* Having used R35 million worth of student funding for luxury accommodation for herself and her executives.* Having bought or planned to purchase student accommodation in Richards Bay at an inflated price.* Having fraudulently awarded a former SRC president academic marks.* Illegally changing accredited programmes to unapproved programmes.* Having been fraudulently appointed to the position of vice-chancellor.He said in his statement that the university had limited funds. Against the backdrop of #FeesMustFall, South Africa as a whole has declared that there are limited funds to fund education. In the interest of the public and to secure the futures of the poor students, whose only hope to get out of poverty is to get an education, we request the SAPS investigate the above allegations. Jamile went on to describe the goings on at the University of Zululand as mass looting . If this situation is not arrested soon (in fact, it is already too late) the entire university will collapse, financially and otherwise, he said.The Mercury approached the university for comment and received a letter from the university s lawyers, Farrell Inc. Attorneys which read: We are instructed to advise you that our client has no knowledge of these investigations whatsoever. In any event Professor Mtose denies all allegations of fraud. Last year, Jamile was subject to an internal disciplinary hearing and found guilty of gross misconduct and gross dishonesty.It is understood that he has since been dismissed, but he yesterday told The Mercury that he was taking his dismissal to the CCMA next week.The University of Zululand has found itself at the centre of various scandals over the past year.The Hawks are also currently investigating an alleged degrees-for-sale scam at the university in which thousands of students allegedly bought their degrees as well as claims that lecturers there were awarding students better marks in return for sex.Their investigations are ongoing, but Business Day last month reported that a university insider who had seen a preliminary report on the university s own investigations had told the publica- tion that it confirmed the allegations and implicated academics and administrative staff.The Mercury
