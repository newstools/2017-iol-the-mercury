Los Angeles - A California state senator has called for the White House to release Melania Trump s immigration documents as part of an objection to President Donald Trump s policies.Democrat Nancy Skinner made the call in reaction to the leader s executive order to restrict funds to sanctuary cities - areas controlled by local authorities that refuse to enforce federal immigration policies.Skinner said: No one in the Trump operation has released any of the documentation to indicate what was the circumstance, or whether she (Melania) had full legal status. We only know they had a lawyer look at whatever papers she chose to give.&quot;&nbsp; The Independent
