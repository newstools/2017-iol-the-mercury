Durban - Durban residents should not be alarmed by a message on water supply that is doing the rounds on social media, however the city s water situation remained critical.This week residents have been sharing a message via social media, which purports to be from deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer. It airs concerns about the city's water supply management. Peer said on Wednesday that while she was aware of it, the message had not been written by her but was instead penned by DA spokesperson for Human Settlements and Infrastructure Martin Meyer.She warned the community against misinformation and politicisation of a serious issue such as water, and urged people to use water wisely. Peer said the demand around the festive season had meant the Mt Moriah reservoir was unable to supply enough water. The Umgeni River Joint Operations Committee was requested to relax restrictions during this period in anticipation of the increase to cater for the influx of visitors to the city.&quot; The 15% curtailment was reinstated on January 16 and the net result saw the reservoir feeding 16 reservoirs downstream of it, causing it to run dry. This is because the demand did not reduce after this period. This had led the city to implement stage-3 restrictions, which included cutting off the daily water supply between 7pm and 6am.Meyer, a ward councillor in Morningside, confirmed that he had written the message and said he had distributed the message to residents after he had discussed the issue with Ednick Msweli,the head of the city s water department.Peer said through her communications team that restrictor discs had been introduced throughout the city to hold water back from low-level zones so that the system could quickly repressurise after the night shutdown.The Mercury
