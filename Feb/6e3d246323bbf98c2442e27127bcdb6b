Durban The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has backed Brian Molefe s appointment to Parliament, saying he was best suited to be the new finance minister.PPF president Mzwanele Manyi said on Sunday his organisation did not understand what the noise was about because Molefe was qualified academically and professionally.He had led some of the best organisations in the country, such as Transnet and Eskom.The PPF support for Molefe came as ANC structures in North West questioned his credentials and membership.ANC provincial chairperson and North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo also backed Molefe.Manyi said they applauded the ANC for sending Molefe to Parliament. We applaud the ANC and Parliament for identifying such talent. We think Brian has the requisite skills and he has a spectacular track record of success. If merit is anything to go by, he has a lot of that.&quot;&quot;To those throwing all kinds of mud, South Africa is a constitutional democracy and has a rule of law. There is no adverse finding against him by any court, said Manyi. Molefe s arrival in Parliament continues to be mired in speculation.Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said on Sunday that no date had been set for the swearing in.It would be determined by the availability of Speaker Baleka Mbete and Molefe.Earlier ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu would not say where Molefe would be deployed in the National Assembly.It is not clear yet if he will be sworn in before Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivers his Budget.Gordhan's Budget is on Wednesday, and it could be his last if Molefe is appointed in the coming days.Political Bureau
