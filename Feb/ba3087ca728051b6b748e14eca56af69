We can confirm an incident that occurred at 4:10pm where a male was shot and injured between Dundee and Greytown Road. It is alleged that the victim was shot while inside his vehicle and was taken to hospital, where he later died. The motive of the killing is unknown at this stage, said Zwane.Provincial Transport, Community Safety and Liason MEC Mxolisi Kaunda condemned Mkhize s killing. We appeal to people not to speculate on the motive for his killing. Police have assured us that the case is receiving maximum attention, and we urge co-operation, said Kaunda. Mkhize s murder comes at a time when as the province we are still reeling from the killing of seven people in Richmond and eMatimatolo. We must never surrender our province to those who want to turn it into a killing field. I wish to send my deepest condolences to the Mkhize family, said Kaunda.He said the random killings taking place in the province were painful and unacceptable.NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu said that Mkhize was no longer a member of their party at the time of his death. The party released him when he was implicated in a murder case involving other party members, said Sigudu.Mkhize and another man were charged for the murder of former Nquthu NFP chairperson and councillor Isaac Nhlebela in 2012. The matter was pending before the court at the time of Mkhize s death.The Mercury
