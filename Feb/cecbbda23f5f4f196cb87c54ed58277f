New York A woman has apparently launched a crowd-funding effort in the hopes of raising $10 000 (R130000) to fund her spiritual journey around the world .Becca Gronski, a self-proclaimed spiritual teacher, life coach, reiki and crystal healer from the US, set up the #GoFundMe page this month to realise her dream of helping people achieve their potential. My dream is to be able to travel the world, helping people see the beautiful potential within themselves and to help them along the way, any way I can. I want to empower people to follow their dreams, learn self-love, create their own reality and express true soul expression! Gronski wrote. I believe we should all have the opportunity to have the things we need at our fingertips, whether or not we have the money for them. So, I want to be able to give freely, without worry, to people who have less or just need a helping hand for the moment. However, the account has garnered criticism from those reluctant to fund what some consider to be an extended holiday. One Twitter user wrote: I have an idea for this traveller. Get a job!! Another wrote on Facebook: Why don t you do some good and if you legitimately care so much about people, donate it to a charity or actual cause vs your own personal travels. Gronski lists multiple jobs on her Facebook page, including being an artist of vagina paintings and selling dreamcatchers on online shopping portal Etsy. Writing on the donation page, she said she was low on funds and working to get on her feet. Gronski was contacted for comment but did not respond. The Independent
