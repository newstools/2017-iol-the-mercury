Durban - Convicted fraudster and former police spokesperson Vincent Mdunge had not as of 5:30pm on Wednesday reported to prison, according to authorities.It was reported - and a source at Westville Prison confirmed - that Mdunge was set to hand himself over on Wednesday.This after a bid to overturn his 2014 fraud and forgery convictions were dismissed by the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday.Mdunge s lawyer, Yusuf Omar, on Tuesday said that he was in the process of finalising instructions from him, to bring another application before the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein.Omar said once the necessary arrangements were made, he would bring another application before the High Court to have Mdunge s bail extended.Attempts to contact Omar on Wednesday were unsuccessful and it was unclear at the time of publishing if any applications had been brought.In 2014, the Durban Regional Court convicted Mdunge for using a fake matric certificate to advance his career within the SAPS and to further his studies. He was convicted on one count of fraud for receiving a salary to which he was not entitled and another, for submitting his forged matric certificate to Unisa.Mdunge was granted bail of R5 000 and is facing five years in prison unless his appeal is successful.The Mercury
