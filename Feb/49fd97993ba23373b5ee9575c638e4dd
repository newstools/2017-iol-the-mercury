Durban Two people facing charges of animal cruelty after being found in possession of the carcasses of 35 skinned donkeys near Underberg were denied bail on Monday.The NSPCA said in a statement on Tuesday that the matter against Morena Kimanu Dlomo and Lati Makatso had been adjourned to February 6 at the Sani Magistrate s Court.The charges of cruelty were laid by the organisation in terms of the Animals Protection Act. Thirty-five donkeys were found skinned in a kraal on a plot of land 8km from the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho in the Twin Springs area, said the body.It said evidence indicated that the method of slaughter was horrendous . Indications on the carcasses show a hole behind the head. That is, the donkeys appear to have been immobilised with an instrument, then skinned, probably while still conscious. Death would have been slow and excruciatingly painful. They said investigations in the area were ongoing. Reports have been received that there are more donkeys in the area which may be at risk. Several days have been spent searching but to no avail. The area is vast and mountainous. This incident comes in the wake of reports regarding the medicinal donkey skin trade from other animal activist groups. To curb the trade, the groups have started an international campaign entitled Under the skin . Right now, millions of donkeys from Asia, Africa and South America are at risk of being stolen and slaughtered for their skins the gelatine in the hide being a key ingredient in the prized traditional Chinese medicine called ejiao (e-gee-yow), said The Donkey Sanctuary UK on its website.In the first comprehensive study of the trade, the charity discovered that as many as 10 million donkeys were at risk and called for an immediate halt to the trade until it can be proven to be sustainable and humane.The Mercury
