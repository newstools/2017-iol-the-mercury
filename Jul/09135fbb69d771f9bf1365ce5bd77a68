Good news for South Coast residents is the erection of a permanent crash barrier over 5km which will prevent illegal U-turns on a section of road known for accidents. This will include the notorious Shelly Beach/Izotsha off-ramp on the R61 where accidents have occurred when motorists made illegal U-turns to avoid paying toll fees. In a statement Sanral said late last year, it had put up temporary barriers to prevent or at least limit drivers contemplating U-turns. SANRAL Eastern Region Project Manager, Salome Naicker, said installation of a permanent wire rope barrier had begun and coincides with the resurfacing of the road. The roads agency is also presently overseeing the resurfacing of 20km of National Route 61 between Mbizana River and the Marburg Interchange. The project also includes the installation of a median wire rope barrier to eliminate the illegal U-turns taking place at the northern side of the Izotsha Interchange.  “Motorists are advised to be observant of the advance warning signs and lane width reduction, and should exercise caution when travelling through the construction works,” said Naicker. The speed limit in the construction area has been reduced to 60km/h. Construction should be completed by end of November.
