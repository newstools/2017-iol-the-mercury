Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said a special task team had been formed to investigate the politically related attacks in the KwaZulu-Natal province. 
The Moerane Commission, which is probing the killings at the notorious Glebelands hostel near uMlazi, Durban, had heard on Monday that the hitmen who had been hired for the shootings of the three Umzimkulu councilors had been sourced from the hostel. 
“The (special task) team believes that they can be of assistance in solving the attempted murder case of the three three Umzimkulu Municipality ward councilors who were shot on 13 July 2017.  “The three were attacked by unknown suspects at the Ibisi area and two suspects were seen fleeing scene in a red motor vehicle,” said Mulaudzi.  
The three wounded victims were taken to hospital for serious medical attention, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the task team had made a breakthrough in the case of the slain ANC councilor Mbhekiseni Khumalo of the uPhongolo Municipality.
Khumalo, 57, was shot in December last year at his Kwalubisi village home by gunmen. 
The Hawks on Monday arrested a 51-year-old suspect, named as Benginkosi Jacob Twala, who appeared in the Phongola Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
He is expected to appear in court again next Wednesday. 
To assist the police with information on the whereabouts of these men, urgently contact the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Benginkosi Jeza on 071 351 7233 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
