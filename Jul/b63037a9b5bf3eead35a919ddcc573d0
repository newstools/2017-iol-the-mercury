The man – who had been driving with his disabled wife in the area – had been shot twice and was in a critical condition, said Garrith Jamieson, spokesman for the Rescue Care paramedics which responded to the incident.
The victim’s wife, said Jamieson, had initially been taken with the vehicle, but was later located and taken to a nearby hospital.
Blue Security – also on the scene – said the man had been shot in the face during the incident in Sanders Road.
Operations director Brian Jackson said in a statement shortly after the incident: “The hijackers shot the man in his face during the hijacking and fled in his vehicle with his wife, who is disabled, still sitting in the passenger seat. 
“The victim was stabilised at the scene and transported to hospital.”
Jackson said a police task team together with security companies, neighbourhood watch groups and volunteers launched a massive search for the woman.
