&nbsp; The leader of one of the gangs responsible for many mall robberies in KwaZulu-Natal has been arrested following an intelligence driven operation by various police units.&nbsp;Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said detectives from the Provincial Mall Robbery Task Team had been tracking the movements of the suspect who remained elusive and was possibly aware that police were looking for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night (Monday) police launched an operation after identifying two residences at AA section &nbsp;and BB section in Umlazi, used as hideouts by these criminals. &nbsp;Naicker said during the operation two suspects were arrested, including the leader of a mall robbery gang. It is believed they had targeted shops that sold jewellery and wrist watches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Police were able to recover wrist watches and expensive perfumes taken in some of the robberies. The main suspect is positively linked at least three mall robberies while the second suspect was found in possession of goods taken during a fourth robbery. &nbsp;Naicker said both men, who are in their early 30s, would appear in court soon.&nbsp;KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the arrests. The Provincial Mall Robbery Task Team has been working around the clock to trace suspects. It is only a matter of time before we reel in other suspects involved. We again appeal to the community not to buy stolen goods and support these criminal gangs, he said.&nbsp;
