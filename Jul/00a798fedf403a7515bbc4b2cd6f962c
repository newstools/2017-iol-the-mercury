An 8-year-old girl from Florida in the US became the youngest female to scale Mount Kilimanjaro recently.The local area website Wink News reported that Roxy Getter of Punta Gorda, Florida, climbed the 19,341-foot (5 890m) mountain in Tanzania with her family, including her 10-year-old brother, Ben.“They were amazing,” said Sarah Getter, their mother. “They did not complain, they just kept going. They actually kept us going, I think, with their positive attitude.”The family spent six nights on their epic adventure, the first they’d ever spent in a tent.They also faced bitterly cold temperatures, particularly as they neared the top.“Your thighs are shaking and your knees are hurting, but you’re just so relieved it’s over and you made it,” Sarah Getter told Wink News. “It’s crazy.”Roxy said she didn’t think she’d make it to the top due to the tough climbing up and down steep hills. And that was way before the summit attempt.Father Bobby Getter was impressed with the entire family’s willpower and determination.“You see them in front of you and you’re just, you can barely do it yourself, and then there they are,” he said. “We’re so proud of them.” Video: http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-40756946/today-i-climbed-kilimanjaro-says-girl-aged-8
