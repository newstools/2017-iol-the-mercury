Former president Nelson Mandela would have turned 99 this year. 
As a tribute to him and his legacy, South Africans and others around the world roll up their sleeves for 67 minutes and go out into their respective communities to lend a helping hand to those in need.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
According to the United Nations (UN), by devoting 67 minutes of their time – one minute for every year of Tata Madiba’s public service – people can make a small gesture of solidarity with humanity and a step towards a global movement for good.
The message behind Mandela Day, said the Nelson Mandela Foundation via their website, was simple: everyone has the ability and the responsibility to change the world for the better.
"If each one of us heeds the call to simply do something good every day, we can live Nelson Mandela’s legacy and help build the country of our dreams.
The baton of leadership has been handed over to us. It is in our hands now to make a positive difference."
The foundation has decided to dedicate 2017 to honouring a great statesman and making every day a Mandela Day by encouraging everyone to take action against poverty in a way that will bring about sustainable change.
