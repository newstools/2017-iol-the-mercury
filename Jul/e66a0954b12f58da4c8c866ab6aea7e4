ER24 paramedics said in a statement that they, along with other services, arrived on the scene at approximately 8.45am to find the taxi and truck in the left-hand lane of the highway. 
ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said that several passengers from the taxi were found walking around on the scene.
"Paramedics assessed the patients and found that five out of the 19 had sustained moderate injuries."
Paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported them to various provincial hospitals for further care, he said.
Traffic was heavily affected due to the collision.
"The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations," said Meiring.
In a separate incident in Wartburg on Sunday, two people were killed and 14 others injured when two taxis collided.
