Vodacom, South Africa’s biggest mobile network by subscribers, has been fined 945million Tanzanian shillings (R5.42m) for registering SIM cards without demanding identity cards among others, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority said. The fine was also as a result of Vodacom Tanzania registering SIM cards with unauthorised identity cards, registering SIM cards without taking photos of subscribers, registering SIM cards without the subscriber’s confirmation of particulars by signing; and for registering SIM cards using other person’s identification documents.
