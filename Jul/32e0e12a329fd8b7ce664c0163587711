“The good news is that the weather improved during the morning and flights have begun to land and depart from the airport,” said Leigh Gunkel-Keuler, spokesperson for the airport, in a statement on Monday.
However, she urged passengers to remain in touch with their airlines through the respective airline contact numbers and web sites for up to date information about delays.
“Given the earlier diversions, we will be challenged with managing flight backlogs throughout the course of the day in order to accommodate those flights which were diverted,” she said.
Gunkel-Keuler said that given this backlog, passengers scheduled to fly out of the airport would experience “considerable delays” throughout the day.
“As airport management we urge all passengers to please prepare for such delays and we apologise for the inconvenience.”
