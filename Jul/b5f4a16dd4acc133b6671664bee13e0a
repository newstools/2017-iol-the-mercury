JOHANNESBURG - Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) reported on Thursday a five percent total platinum production increase to 617,000 ounces in the second quarter ending 30 June, with strong performances from Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and Unki mines. 
Amplats said Mogalakwena production increased by 15 percent to 113,900 ounces due to a strong increase in built-up head grade.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Amandelbult production increased by four percent to 110,500 ounces due to improved plant recoveries and increased throughputs from underground sources.
 
Unki production was up 10 percent to 19,500 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control have reduced mining waste, leading to increased grade and higher production.
 
But Union mine production decreased by three percent to 39,800 ounces due to a reduction in mining of Merensky ore which reduced the overall grade. 

Union mine was sold to Siyanda Resources in February and the transaction is expected to complete by year-end.
Amplats said the increase in production was despite the Twickenham project being placed on care and maintenance in the second half of 2016, reducing unprofitable platinum production by 1,900 ounces.
Also, with the sale of Rustenburg mines to Sibanye Gold in November 2016, Amplats said production is now treated as third party purchase of concentrate from Sibanye, resulting in own mine production decreasing by 22 percent.

Amplats said sales volumes for the quarter of 600,500 ounces were down 26 percent due to the decrease in refined platinum production.
 
Amplats maintained its full year production guidance at 2.35 million to 2.40 million platinum ounces.
