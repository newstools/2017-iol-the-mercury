After almost a month after their first sighting, the sardines have made another appearance, this time on the lower South Coast.  ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Head of operations for the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board Mike Anderson-Reade said in a statement that numerous shoals of sardines had been spotted in the area between St Michaels on Sea and Ramsgate. 
“Netting by commercial seine netters has taken place at Ski-Boat Bay (Ramsgate), Ramsgate Main Beach, Margate and St Michaels on Sea. Some of these nets have been very good hauls in the region of 120 crates of sardines.”
She said two small nets of mixed baitfish which included sardines were also taken at Umkomaas.
Anderson-Reade said this activity on the lower South Coast was currently ongoing and was may continue over the next few days.
“Although there does not appear to be much predator activity accompanying these shoals, shark safety gear has been removed from all beaches from Hibberdene up to and including Port Edward as a precautionary measure to avoid any unnecessary captures.”
This gear, he said, would only be replaced as and when the sardine shoals move away. “Bathers are urged to check with local lifeguards as to the state of bathing prior to entering the water.”
 Anderson-Reade said in June that a total of 110 crates were netted in one net at Scottburgh’s main beach.
“Twenty-five crates of mackerel were also netted. Reports suggest that numerous shoals of baitfish have been seen between Scottburgh and uMtwalume and it is highly likely that some, but not all of these, are sardines,” he said at the time.
