Tbo Touch, whose real name is Thabo Molefe, was roasted by the Black Twitter faithful who said they were hurt by his inference. 

Tbo Touch, who heads up the digital radio station, Touch HD, had tweeted late on Tuesday evening: 

"The only difference between the guy I just drove pass begging in streets and myself is our mental disposition. Let's change how we THINK". 

By midday on Wednesday, Tbo Touch had not responded to the criticism leveled at him, but instead had tweeted pictures of his servings on a trip to Nigeria. What the entrepreneur had hoped to be an inspiring tweet was seen as a "fake deep" tweet by the twitterati. 


Angered by Tbo Touch's tweets, the twitterati responded: 







And some got personal and attacked Tbo Touch about his accent.





The "deep fakeness" of this tweet is about as fake as your twang.

Please delete this. It sounds like privilege. It's nauseating and very aloof. Please check it out. And you know I got your back!

And there were memes to drive the point through to one of South Africa's most popular radio DJs.
