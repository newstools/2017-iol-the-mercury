Popular tourist attraction Margate beach has been closed due to a pump malfunction at Margate 4A pump station which caused a sewage spillage at Nkongweni Lagoon on Friday.Spokesperson Simon April said the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality took the decision to close the beach for bathing and recreational activities for the protection of beach-goers and other citizens."Ray Nkonyeni Municipality wishes to state on record that it received a report from the Ugu District Municipality Environmental Health only after it was inundated by queries on the issue.  "After water tests were done in the lagoon it was discovered that the Ecoli levels were far above the accepted levels hence the closure of the lagoon."April said on Sunday they received authorisation for breaching and the river mouth was opened. Water samples were taken from the breached area and the swimming area below the Wimpy. "Signage prohibiting the use of the beach for bathing and recreational purposes was then erected."April said the malfunction of the pump had been corrected."The situation is monitored on a daily basis and water sampling is done and we are optimistic that the beach will be opened soon."The municipality apologised for the inconvenience.
