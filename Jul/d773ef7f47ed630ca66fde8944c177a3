Paramedics in Gauteng had a difficult day attending to two heartbreaking scenes on Monday.A new-born baby boy and a foetus were found dumped in separate incidents, ER24 reported on Tuesday.The body of the new-born boy was found in a rubbish bin outside a complex in Douglasdale, Fourways, on Monday morning.ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring said paramedics had been called to the scene just after 10am after they were alerted by the complex’s security, and found that the baby had been wrapped in a cloth and plastic bag. The body was apparently found by a man rummaging through the bins.“It was evident to paramedics that the baby had been dead for some time,” Meiring said. “Nothing could be done for the baby."In a separate incident on the same day, paramedics were alerted at about 7am to a foetus which had been discovered in a bin in Weltevreden Park on the West Rand of Gauteng.“Paramedics found the foetus inside the rubbish bin, showing no signs of life,” Meiring said. Authorities were investigating both incidents. - ANA
