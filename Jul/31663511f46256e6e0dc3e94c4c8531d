The 32-year-old man was shot dead on Wednesday night at the hostel’s Block P.
His death comes after the KZN Premier Willies Mchunu instituted the Moerane Commission to probe political killings in the province. The commission started last week and is currently in recess. 
Independent Community Activist Vanessa Burger said it was the second time the man had been ambushed, having survived a hit two years ago. 
“This was the second time this resident had been attacked. On November 19, 2015 he was shot - together with his mechanic while working on his vehicle - in almost exactly the same manner at precisely the same time. Hitmen from Block O were suspected on that occasion,” she said.
And on Wednesday night the man was shot several times near his small shop, according to Burger. 
“The sound of the suspects’ gunfire – who continued firing into the air to deter potential witnesses peering from windows in nearby blocks – disappeared in the direction of Blocks H, I, J and K, near the disused tennis courts,” she said.
The victim was rushed to hospital on Wednesday night but died on Thursday morning. Burger said CCTV footage is located near the area the man was shot.
Burger said in a statement that police stationed at the hostel could have reported to the scene faster. 
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the man was shot in the head and the motive for his killing was unknown. She said police were investigating a case of murder and said police remained deployed at the hostel on a 24-hour basis. 
“We encourage residents living in the hostel to report criminal activities to police so that we can stem the unnecessary loss of lives,” said Mbhele.
