“(We) arrived on the scene to find the single vehicle (a taxi) had collided with a tree. The driver was found inside the vehicle. He had sustained fatal injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for him.”
He was declared dead on the scene. 
“Fortunately, there were no passengers in the taxi at the time of the collision.”
 In a separate incident, a cyclist sustained moderate injuries after he was hit by a vehicle on the M7 West Bound near Hans Dettman Highway just after 6am on the same day.
“(We) arrived on the scene to find the patient lying in the busy highway. He had sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care he required.”
Jamieson said the exact cause of the collisions were unknown.
“However, the necessary authorities were on scene and will be investigating further.”
