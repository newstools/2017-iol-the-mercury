He had been in the water for about 40 minutes.NSRI national spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the skipper had been wearing a life-jacket and was taken on to the sea rescue craft Ray Farnham and treated for hypothermia."His concerned wife arrived at the base and she was reunited with her husband but understandably in an emotional state."She had to be treated for chest pains and both the husband and wife were transported to hospital by ambulance in stable conditions. They are both expected to make a full recovery.It appears that the skipper had gone below deck to the bathroom and, after he failed to return to the top deck, the crew had searched for him and the alarm was raised.The skipper confirmed that he had slipped and fallen overboard while returning to the top deck.
