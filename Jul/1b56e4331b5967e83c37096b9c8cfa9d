The South African Police Union (Sapu) has condemned the deployment of public order police outside Minister Nathi Nhleko’s northern KwaZulu-Natal home, saying politicians should stop abusing the system. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Sapu’s provincial secretary Nurse Mdletshe said they had written to provincial police management last month after their members who are part of the Empangeni cluster public order police complained about their members being placed outside Nhleko’s uMhlathuzana home.
According to weekend media reports, eight police officers and a nyala armoured vehicle were guarding the public works minister’s home in which his son, domestic worker and a groundsman live.
Mdletshe said guarding of officials was under the auspices of the police’s VIP protection services, adding that the guarding of Nhleko’s house was irregular as he was absent. He also questioned the use of public order police.
“Politicians are abusing the system. They are not afraid to just talk to someone in police management to give authority for our members to act on instruction. It seems like this arrangement was made through a gentleman’s agreement done nicodemously.”
Mdletshe said their enquiry to VIP protection services management was referred to public order police who in turn said they would investigate after Sapu wrote to them. 
“That is why they were removed, because they were doing work they are not supposed to. Public order police are supposed to be out there protecting and preventing chaos in riots and protests,” said Mdletshe.
Ivan Fredericks, general manager of the Public Servants Association of South Africa, whose members include police officers, also condemned the misuse of police officers at taxpayers’ expense.
Zwakele Mncwango, DA leader in the province, said lack of resources was often used as an excuse for the failures in preventing and combating  crime.
