Margate Beach has been reopened to bathers, said authorities on Wednesday. Spokesperson for the Ugu District municipality, France Zama, made the announcement in a statement following their recently received water test results. The beach was closed after a pump malfunctioned at Margate 4A pump station which resulted in a sewage spillage at Nkongweni Lagoon on Friday last week. “After some water tests were done in the lagoon it was discovered that the E. Coli levels were far above the accepted levels hence the closure of the lagoon,” said Ray Nkonyeni municipal spokesperson Simon April in a statement this week. On Sunday, said April, authorisation had been obtained for the breaching of the river mouth which was opened. “Water samples were taken from the breached and swimming areas. Signage prohibiting the use of the beach for bathing and recreational purposes was then erected and this was done to safeguard the health of beachgoers and lifeguards, paddle ski operators and the community on site was also sensitised,” said April. Zama said on Wednesday that the beach had received a clean bill of health and had been declared safe for recreational activities. “The lagoon still remains closed so to prevent any health risks that may be associated with pollution resulting from the spillage. And we have closed the lagoon mouth to prevent any form of pollution from entering the beach bathing area while strict monitoring is under way.” Zama said an appeal was being made to the public not to make their way to the lagoon until it had been certified safe.
