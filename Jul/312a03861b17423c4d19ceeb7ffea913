The race has not yet been run, but the Vodacom Durban July has already delivered drama with top Durban jockey Muzi Yeni losing a desperate race against time last night to get to Durban from Mauritius to ride Ten Gun Salute, at present the joint fourth favourite at 8-1.&nbsp; Yeni has been stopped from leaving Mauritius by authorities, while they investigate controversial postings on social media. Horse trainer Duncan Howells said jockey Weichong Marwing, who has yet to win the big race, has been confirmed to ride Ten Gun Salute in Yeni s place.&nbsp;This came as fashionistas, celeb queens, music legends, movie stars and sports icons prepare to rub shoulders with captains of industry and political heavyweights today, at the most glamorous event on the South African social calendar.&nbsp;Details of the Mauritian investigation are sketchy, but according to Yeni s attorney in South Africa, Bruce Armstrong, the chances of Yeni leaving the island before Monday are minimal. It is also alleged that jockeys Raymond Danielson and Brandon Lerena were videoed aboard a yacht owned by a Mauritian.bookmaker, an illegal relationship on the island, and have each been handed three-month suspensions by Mauritian racing authorities. According to Armstrong, Yeni tried to leave on Thursday night, but was detained at the airport. After being questioned by police, he was released on a warning that it was an ongoing investigation and that he was not to leave the island. Yeni had earlier submitted to a Mauritian Jockey Club inquiry after damning postings on social media, but was cleared of the charges because there was no evidence the posts had come from his phone.But now that he is under investigation by the Mauritian police tasked with racing matters, he is unlikely to leave the island until the earliest on Monday, on condition he returns to face any charges should they arise, according to Armstrong.Mauritius Turf Club director of racing, Benoit Halbwachs, told the Sporting Post yesterday that Yeni was prevented from leaving the island as police investigations into the WhatsApp case continued. We did not find Mr Yeni guilty in this matter and the police are not telling us anything further. I spoke to them this morning and they have nothing to say. The jockey is not under arrest and has freedom of movement on the island, he said.Halbwachs added that the Mauritius Turf Club would decide what action to take against Yeni in respect of the case, where he was alleged to be one of three jockeys to have enjoyed a boat trip with a bookmaker. Danielson and Lerena have already lodged appeals against their suspensions.In Yeni s absence, Howells was forced to cast around for a suitable rider for Ten Gun Salute. In his absence, Marwing, who has vast international experience, will get his chance to take on the Vodacom Durban July.Ten Gun Salute and last year's winner, The Conglomerate, were the money horses in the ante-post market. Both were steadily supported from 12-1 over the past few days, into joint fourth favourites at 8-1.The two three-year-olds, Edict Of Nantes and Al Sahem, were steady joint favourites at 5-1 for the past week, along with Black Arthur who shortened from 7-1.The champagne and caviar set are expected to arrive from across the country for the event, expected to bring an estimated R260 million over the weekend, excluding the R100m gambling splurge of the year, in betting alone.&nbsp;While the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me mingle in showstopping marquees, topped by Durban's own business mogul, Vivian Reddy, celebs may be spotted in Afrotainment, Vodacom Red, Equus Lounge and Boomtown s Jack Daniel s and Glenlivet Jazz Town.&nbsp;In from the US for the event will be US superstars, Robin Thicke and French Montana, expected in the Mabala Noise marquee, while Afrotainment s DJ Tira said he couldn't wait for the party to begin with the likes of Cassper Nyovest, Kwesta, Nasty C, DJ Fresh and AKA, Shekinah and Sketchy Bongo.Being the fashion event of the year, super-celeb Minnie Dlamini s sexy gown by Gert-Johan Coetzee is already talked about, so there is much anticipation for the wow factor on the red carpet.
