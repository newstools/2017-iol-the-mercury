As of July 17, 2017, India visa applicants will have to enrol biometrics in person while submitting applications at VFS Global India Visa Application Centres in South Africa.E-visa holders will need to enroll biometrics at Indian immigration, or to save time can do so before leaving South Africa.From July 117, biometric enrolment becomes a mandatory part of the India visa application process, as per the High Commission of India, Pretoria, South Africa. Fingerprints and facial image can be submitted along with visa applications at any of VFS Global’s three application centres in South Africa, located in Johannesburg, in Durban (Silverton Road, Musgrave) and Cape Town. A statement issued on behalf of VFS Global said applicants who receive e-visas would be required to enrol biometrics upon landing in India, with the immigration authorities at the respective Indian airports. As this process may be time-consuming, applicants can instead enrol biometrics in South Africa itself at the India Visa Application Centres mentioned above, which would ease out the travel process. Process to enrol biometrics:Once the online application form is filled, applicants can schedule an appointment at the India Visa Application Centre to enroll biometrics and submit applicationsApplicants can visit the centre at the allotted time and provide their biometrics.Biometrics data will remain valid for 59 months from the date of enrolment. Once an applicant has enrolled biometrics, he/she will be exempted from enrolling biometrics for the subsequent 59-month period.The diplomatic mission, however, reserves the right to demand repeat enrolment on a case-to-case basis as part of their process. - info VFS Global
