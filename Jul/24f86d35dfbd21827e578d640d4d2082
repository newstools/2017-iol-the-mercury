Decades after their chance encounter – which altered the course of the then law student’s life – wholesaler Suleman “Solly” Bux and Constitutional Court Justice Raymond Zondo finally got to shake hands.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
And the meeting at the judge’s Durban home on Monday, Bux told The Mercury, felt in many ways like one between old friends.
“It was very exciting for both of us, and our families. There was no awkwardness at all. His family is very down to earth so we felt very comfortable there.”
The Mercury reported last month that more than 40 years ago, Bux – then based in Ixopo – made a deal with a young Zondo to provide groceries for his family so he would have an opportunity to further his education and study law.
But when Zondo returned to settle his debt after graduating from university, Bux refused to take the money and instead asked him to pay the kindness forward.
Zondo, who was appointed the deputy chief justice, during his JSC interview for the post earlier this year, tearfully recounted the story. 
“We felt welcomed in their home and we shared many interests.”
Bux said: “It was also very emotional for us. 
“He came from hard beginnings so it made it even more special.”
Bux was joined by his wife, cousins and nephews.
“Everyone wanted to come along to meet the family.”
The families also exchanged gifts.
“He gave me a very nice watch, which was very generous. I was moved by the gesture.”
He said he had not expected the story to have received as much attention as it did.
“You know, I helped him because it was the right thing to do. 
“As a Muslim, helping others is important. 
“But you do it because you want to, not because you want recognition and for everyone to know.”
He said that he and Zondo intended maintaining their friendship.
“But the next time we meet, there’ll be no cameras,” he joked.
