“Tragically five people, including both drivers, died at the scene (three women and two men); their ages ranged between 25 and 50.”
Dollman said two occupants were alive and trapped in one of the vehicles. 
“Fire fighters used the ‘Jaws of Life’ to cut the car and release the trapped occupants from the compacted wreck.”
He said that a 15-year-old girl was in a critical condition and placed on a ventilator at the scene while a 17-year-old boy had also sustained severe injuries. 
“Both were attended to by Advanced Life Support paramedics and transported by ambulances to hospital for the further urgent medical care that they required.”
