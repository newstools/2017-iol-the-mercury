Brian McKnight has earned himself a spot in contemporary music history. He has released 17 albums to date, with several going two and three times platinum, and he has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. 
In addition to being a singer, songwriter and producer, McKnight is also a talented and charismatic personality who has hosted “Soul Session Countdown with Brian McKnight” on BETJ. 
The Brian McKnight Morning Show on KTWV the Wave Smooth Jazz radio station, was a Top Five rated show two years running. 
McKnight has also used his vast industry knowledge as a red carpet host for Extra! In 2007, McKnight stepped into Broadway with a successful run as Billy Flynn in Chicago. 
Now to mark his 25th anniversary as a recording artist, McKnight will debut his 18th album, Genesis, on August 25, 2017, which will be released worldwide through SRG | SONOS Recording Group and will feature the hit single “Forever.” 
As the lead single from Genesis, “Forever” quickly hit the Top 20 on Billboard’s Adult R&B Songs chart and continues to surge up the Adult R&B (Urban AC) radio charts all over the country.


Brandy has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide (including the five times platinum selling Never Say Never) and is ranked one of the best-selling female artists in American music history by the RIAA, having sold over 11 million albums in the United States. 
During her career, she recorded five albums: in 1998 “Never Say Never”; in 2002 “Full Moon”; in 2004 “Afrodisiac”; in 2008 “Human”; and in 2012 “Two Eleven”.
Brandy has also earned scores of awards, including a Grammy, an AMA, two Soul Train Music Awards, two NAACP Image Awards, three Billboard Awards, four MTV Awards, six Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, two Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, and three BMI Awards. 
At the top of 2016, Brandy released “Beggin and Pleadin”, a bluesy trap-soul melody that was greeted with much admiration.
