Transnet said yesterday that it experienced interruptions to its operations on the Richards Bay coal line as a result of violent community protests in certain areas of northern KwaZulu-Natal. According to Transnet, the protests related to community demands for jobs and business opportunities. The disruption resulted in the suspension of coal line operations, service to customers and potential losses to the South African economy. The Richard’s Bay coal line is the country’s dedicated railway line which handles South Africa’s coal exports by connecting the mines in Mpumalanga with the coal terminal at the port of Richards Bay. The line also moves domestic commodities such aschrome, coke, chemicals and timber. ANA
