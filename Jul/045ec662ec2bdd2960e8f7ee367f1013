Over the years DIFF has been successful in bringing together different filmmakers and industry experts from around the globe, recognizing talented filmmakers whose work may not have made it onto the mainstream, creating platforms for learning and a breeding ground for growth within the industry. 

The festival opens on Thursday (July 13) evening.

Festival Manager Chipo Zhou said recently that the festival was evolving and with it came change with a fresh take that allowed for instigation of new and novel ideas, a reinterpretation of the existing elements that thrived and a maintenance of that which was institutionally sound. “Transformation, even when good, comes with inherent challenges requiring one to learn from the past, keeping up with technological advancements and an ability to foresee and adjust to the socio-political landscape but nonetheless staying true to the vision to ensure the two spheres are harmonious. It also means flexibility beyond the current edition, which some of the pilot projects this year aim to do, as a build up to our 40th celebration.”



Zhou said their current stakeholders had been “extremely supportive” and as a result of their collaborations beyond the financial support, they had managed to expand their industry programme, making it more accessible to the public with a thrust on the technical and aesthetic elements that helped make a production great. 

“Furthermore, we have been able to grow our outreach programmes this year by zoning in on emerging filmmakers in partnership with film schools around the country, in an effort to nurture young talent through giving them access to platforms that allow for their engagement with industry at a strategic level.”
