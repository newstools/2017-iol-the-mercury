Durban -&nbsp;ECR drive time deejay and funnyman Phat Joe will be moving on from the station after a year, the station announced on Tuesday afternoon. East Coast Radio said they and Phat Joe had mutually agreed not to renew his contract.&nbsp; Phat Joe, who has been with ECR for a year, is leaving the station due to a variety of exciting new commitments outside of KZN, said the radio station in a statement. Phat Joe has contributed substantially to East Coast Radio in his time as Drive presenter, but his demanding schedule has put undue pressure on him. Phat Joe has been no stranger to controversy and angered striking students last year when he called students who burnt down buildings, the worst people in the world . The deejay said he was victim of an anti-Phat Joe campaign and went to the UKZN to clear the air and clarify his statements with students. He also survived complaints, including from an infuriated parent and over comments he made about tattooing a baby . East Coast Radio Programming Manager Zane Derbyshire said on Tuesday, Phat Joe is one of the most respected entertainment personalities in South Africa, and while the relationship has ended sooner than we would have liked, we understand the demanding nature of his new projects. At the same time the Drive show is one of the flagship shows on the station and requires the full-time dedication of its host in Durban.&nbsp; &quot;We would like to wish Joe all the success with his new ventures. He remains a friend of East Coast Radio. A new host for the show will be announced shortly.
