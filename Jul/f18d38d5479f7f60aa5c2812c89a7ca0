A multidisciplinary law enforcement operation this past weekend saw three suspects arrested, and unlicensed weapons and ammunition recovered in Kranskop in the KZN Midlands.  Umzinyathi Crime Intelligence, K9 unit, Public Order Police and Kranskop police embarked on an intelligence driven operation following up on information about illegal weapons. Kranskop is an area known for faction fighting. Police spokesperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane said the SANDF assisted, providing a helicopter in areas where police were battling with the rugged terrain. He said the three arrested were in possession of a large amount of dagga.  “A total of seven unlicensed firearms with various assorted ammunition were recovered. The firearms seized included 308 rifles, .38 special revolvers, 9mm pistols and hunting rifles. A large quantity of dagga, axe and knives were also seized.”  He said the suspects would appear in the Kranskop Magistrate’s Court this week facing a number of criminal charges. KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa said the weapons would be subjected to ballistic tests.  “Kranskop and the surrounding area also known as the areas that were affected by faction fights and the killing of innocent people. By recovering such firearms, the police will minimise or prevent such incidents.” He urged communities to provide information about people in possession of illegal firearms in their areas.  Community members should call Crime Stop on 08600 10111, he said.
