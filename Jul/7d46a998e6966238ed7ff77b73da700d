Paramedics responded to reports that a man had collapsed on the beach while fishing near a popular Wild Coast hotel resort at about noon on Sunday. &nbsp;Netcare 911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said reports from the scene indicated that beachgoers started CPR on the elderly man, while others went to call for help and paramedics from the nearby resort came to assist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollman said the medics then called Netcare 911. CPR was performed for approximately 45 minutes but despite the efforts of all involved, the 71-year-old man died at the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;Dollman said their information was that the man was from Durban. It was believed he might have just caught a fish as his fishing rod was nearby with a fish still on the hook.&nbsp;For privacy - as the beach was busy - paramedics moved the deceased to the resort s medical room.&nbsp;Despite the sad ending, paramedics commended those who had applied CPR and tried to save the man s life.&nbsp;&nbsp; We encourage everyone, especially parents, to learn first aid and CPR. You never know when you may be called upon to save the life of a stranger or loved one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
