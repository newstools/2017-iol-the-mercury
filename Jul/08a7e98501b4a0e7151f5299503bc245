A rescue group swooped into action at the weekend when the team noticed a seagull in distress.
The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), while preparing for routine exercises, found a seagull with a broken wing at their Table Bay sea rescue station on Saturday.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Station commander Quentin Botha said the bird was captured and transported by their crew to SANCCOB (the SA Foundation for the Conservation of Costal Birds).
“The seagull is expected to make a full recovery.”
Also in the Table Bay area, the yacht C-Gull requested their assistance reporting motor failure with five crew onboard (four males and a female) just off-shore of the Port of Table Bay and requiring a tow to the Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC).
“Our sea rescue craft Spirit of Day rendezvoused with the yacht. 
A tow-line was rigged and we towed them to the emergency moorings at RCYC without incident and once safely moored no further assistance was required.”
