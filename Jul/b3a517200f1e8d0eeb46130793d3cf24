The colour red, a laughing Buddha, the dark eye, a shamrock or a lucky horseshoe. These could all bring good luck to punters who hope to take home a few winnings after today s Vodacom Durban July, according to Durban psychic Minaxie MG Gihwala.Reading the cards ahead of the big race, set to start at 4.20pm, MG s predictions for possible winners include Edict of Nantes, Black Arthur, Al Sahem, Horizon and French Navy.&nbsp; The first card revealed the energy of learning, which I would interpret as Edict of Nantes.&quot;The second card was The Emperor, which brings to mind King Arthur, so I would say Black Arthur, she said.&nbsp;Her third card spoke of keeping your eye on the bigger picture , translating into her choice of Horizon, while Al Sahem is interpreted from the World Card which indicates a foreign energy. MG also listed French Navy in her top five simply because he was her favourite in last year s race.If you don t like her choices, there are ways to harness psychic energy to work out potential winners through the ancient art of numerology. Energy controls everything. There will be a name that will attract you to a horse and this could be because of the numerological number the horse s name will add up to.&nbsp;&quot;Some numbers are a lot more powerful than others, she said.&nbsp;But when it comes to this year s theme The Colour of Magic , MG was definite in her choice red.&nbsp; There is no one colour of magic. But for today, the colour is red because red signifies wealth, prosperity and good fortune.&quot;&nbsp; THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
