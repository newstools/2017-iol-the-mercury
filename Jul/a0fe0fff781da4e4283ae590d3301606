Last week, a group of businesspeople and companies secured an interim order against the MEC for Education in the province, Mthandeni Dlungwana.
The judge ordered current service providers for the NSNP to continue operating under the terms of their existing service level agreements, and interdicted new service providers from working.
The case centres on allegations of irregularities in the tender process.
The businesspeople and companies claim some of those to whom the three-year tenders were given do not exist, are in the process of deregistration or have not paid their annual returns.
They said the process was not transparent, and labelled it “corrupt”.
On Sunday, Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said they were opposing the case in court on Monday, adding that the internal appeal process was under way.
New service providers took over operations when schools reopened last week.
The process faltered, with late food deliveries on Monday and Tuesday, leaving scores of children without food.
The DA said in a statement that the department and the Treasury had met with the aggrieved parties.
“It was resolved at the meeting that as of August 1, current contracts will be voided so that previous food providers will again provide meals at schools. This is a temporary reprieve to ensure that pupils receive their daily meals,” said the party’s provincial spokesperson on education, Dr Rishigen Viranna.
He told The Mercury that this was according to a source at the meeting. 
But Mthethwa could not confirm this, and Treasury spokesperson Musa Cebisa could only confirm taking part in the discussions.
